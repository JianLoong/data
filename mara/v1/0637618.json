Following the Authority's investigation into two complaints in relation the Agent's conduct, the Authority was satisfied that a decision to suspend was appropriate as the Agent was party to a fraud which resulted in the provision of false and misleading statements and documentation to the Department in relation to a number of applications and where he failed to recognize, else elected to ignore, who his clients were for the purpose of providing immigration assistance and lodging sponsorship, nomination and visa applications. The Authority also found that the Agent had breached clauses 2.1, 2.9, 2.9A, 2.19, 2.23, 5.2, 5.5 and 6.1 of the Code of Conduct.
