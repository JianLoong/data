Of particular concern were: \n-the Agent’s failure to take steps to address the impact upon the clients and his attempt to distance himself from the complaint; \n-the Agent’s attempt to mislead the Authority during the course of the investigation of the complaint; and \n-his indifference to his professional responsibilities.\n\nThe Agent cannot provide immigration assistance while his suspension is registered.  On 25 May 2015, the Agent applied for a review of the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  On 20 October 2015, the Agent withdrew his application for review.  The suspension remains in effect until the Agent meets the conditions stipulated in the Authority's decision of 30 April 2015.\n\nAn abridged version of the decision is attached below.
