    "DecisionSummary": "On 12 April 2012 the Authority made a decision to suspend the Agent's registration as a migration agent for a period of three years, and until she has met certain conditions. <br> <br>   Following the Authority's investigation of 2 complaints, the Authority was satisfied that the Agent had breached the following clauses of the Code of Conduct for registered migration agents: 2.1, 5.2, 6.1, 8.1 and 8.3. <br> <br>   In summary, the Authority was satisfied that the Agent: <br> <br>   • failed to deal with the complainants competently, diligently and fairly by permitting her husband, Mr B, who is not a registered migration agent, from giving immigration assistance while she remained the registered migration agent on the record. <br> <br>   • failed to exercise effective control over her office. <br> <br>   • failed to prevent Mr B from misleading the complainants in relation to who was the registered migration agent. <br> <br>   • did not give one complainant an estimate of the fees for service. <br> <br>   • did not keep requisite copies of written communications and file notes. <br> <br> <br>   Taking into account the serious consequences and impact that the Agent's conduct had on her clients, and the fact that she had been previously cautioned in relation to a similar complaint, the Authority was also satisfied that the Agent was not a person of integrity or a fit and proper person to provide immigration assistance.  <br> <br>  The Authority found that the Agent's behaviour toward the complainants was misleading and that the Agent, in conjunction with Mr B, had acted to deceive the complainants.  <br> <br>   An abridged version of the decision is attached below. Details of clients have been removed in the interests of protecting the privacy of the parties involved. The removed portions are denoted by square brackets.     <br> <br>   On 3 May 2012 the Agent applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the Authority's decision.     On 8 July 2013 the Agent's application for review was dismissed under section 42A of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act.",
