    "DecisionSummary": "On 28 September 2017, the Authority decided to suspend the registration of registered migration agent Joseph Zheng for a period of 6 months and until certain conditions are met. Following the Authority's investigation into two complaints in relation to the Agent's conduct, the Authority was satisfied that the Agent demonstrated a lack of knowledge and understanding of migration law and procedures and of his obligations as a migration agent. The Authority was satisfied such conduct contributed to adverse outcomes for his clients. The Agent has demonstrated a lack of accountability for his actions directing blame to other parties including his clients, the Department and the Authority. Further, the Agent has failed to respond properly to the Authority in respect to the complaints, and in so doing has demonstrated a disregard for the role of the Authority and his obligations under the Code of Conduct.  The Authority found that the Agent had breached clauses 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, 6.1 and 9.3 of the Code of Conduct. The Authority also found that the Agent was not a person of integrity and not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance. An abridged version of the Authority’s decision can be accessed below. Personal details have been removed in the interests of protecting the privacy of the persons involved.\n\nThe agent has applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the suspension decision.\n\nOn 23 October 2017, the AAT granted the Agent a stay order to be in effect from 28 September 2017 until 25 October 2017.",
