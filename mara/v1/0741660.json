This decision followed an investigation and disciplinary action by the State Administrative Tribunal of Western Australia (the ‘Tribunal’) regarding the Agent’s conduct as a real estate agent.  Findings by the Tribunal included that the Agent accepted property management fees while not having a valid appointment; failed to act in accordance with the instructions of the owners; and withdrew funds from a trust account without authority. The Agent failed to declare this investigation in his registration application and, as such, has provided false and misleading information to the Authority.  In doing so the Agent has breached clause 2.9A of the Code and has demonstrated disregard for Australian law.  Based on the findings of the tribunal and the fact that the Agent provided false and misleading information to the Authority, the Authority was satisfied that the Agent was not a person of integrity and was otherwise not fit and proper to give immigration assistance. Taking into account the seriousness of the Agent’s conduct, and in the interests of consumer protection, the Authority considered that a suspension from practice for a period of 12 months, and completion of remedial training, was appropriate in the circumstances.  An abridged version of the decision can be accessed below. Personal details have been removed in the interests of protecting the privacy of persons involved.",
