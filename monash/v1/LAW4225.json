It examines ways of lawyering that employ non-adversarial, psychologically beneficial and humanistic methods of solving legal problems, resolving legal disputes and preventing legal difficulties. Students will learn about a range of non-adversarial processes in both the civil and criminal justice systems and the theories behind them. A focus of student learning will be upon understanding when the use of such processes may be appropriate or inappropriate. The aim of teaching students this is to help them to understand the role that lawyers can play in preventing conflict and in providing non-adversarial means of conflict management or resolution. Students will be asked to reflect upon the role that lawyers can and do play in non-adversarial processes and upon the ethics of legal practice in such circumstances.","enjoyResponse":51,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4225","eftsl":0.125}
