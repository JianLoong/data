The unit introduces the student to the requisite knowledge required to perform an ultrasound examination of abdominal organs, including the physics of ultrasound and instrumentation, sonographic anatomy and pathophysiology, scanning principles and practice. Students will participate in the scanning of models under supervision to enable them to apply these principles and develop basic practical skills in a simulated clinical environment.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD3061","eftsl":0.125}
