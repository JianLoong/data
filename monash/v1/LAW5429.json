It focuses specifically on commercial negotiations (understood broadly to encompass pre-contract and contract negotiations, management of issues in the life of a commercial relationship, and the negotiated resolution of commercial disputes), although many of the concepts and skills are also relevant to negotiation in other fields of practice.Topics covered will include: the procedural challenges associated with specific types of negotiation; agency tensions for lawyers working in commercial contexts; whether \"relationships\" matter in a field focused strongly on financial interests; designing deals for maximum value; managing the negotiation process \"at the table\"; strategic preparation and moves \"away from the table\" to set up the best conditions for negotiation; cross-border negotiations; multiparty dynamics and other challenges arising from specific types of negotiation; ethics in commercial negotiations; and the impact of the legal system on commercial negotiation (and vice versa).The unit will be delivered in a highly interactive fashion, and will explore issues and develop skills using negotiation role-plays, small group exercises and and full-class discussions, building on themes introduced through interactive lectures, guest lectures and audio-visual input.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5429","eftsl":0.125}
