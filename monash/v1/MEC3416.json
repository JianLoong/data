Geometric and economic tolerancing is further explored. The use of solid modeling software to simulate the behaviour of mechanical devices and produce engineering drawings is introduced. The integration of design skills and related engineering studies is covered through a group exercise to design a mechanical device.","enjoyResponse":115,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC3416","eftsl":0.125}
