It deals with technical understanding but also with the cultural position of the genre in the context of contemporary practices. In studio classes using life models and through projects which cultivate curiosity and inquiry, students investigate and create rich images involving the human body. A practical study of the work of historical and contemporary exemplars of body imagery is an important part of the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DWG3529","eftsl":0.125}
