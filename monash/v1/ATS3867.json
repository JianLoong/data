How do crime narratives investigate key social and political issues in Hispanic societies? This unit examines fiction and film from Spain and Latin America, and is concerned with understanding the ways in which crime and detective narratives, some of the most popular forms of fiction and film today, investigate and interrogate issues of national identity, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and historical justice in Hispanic societies. Students will be introduced to the codes and conventions of the crime genre and their adoption and adaptation by writers from Spain and Latin America. There will be an emphasis on works by contemporary writers and directors. Students will have the opportunity to develop a project on a specific national text or context.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3867","eftsl":0.125}
