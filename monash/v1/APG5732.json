The unit begins by introducing the three main ethical theories - Kantianism, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics - and explains how each theory characteristically approaches issues in professional ethics. It moves on to examine euthanasia and the medical and nursing professions; zealous advocacy and the legal profession; and social justice and business professionals. It also deals with whistle-blowing and some issues in the moral psychology of professional roles.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5732","eftsl":0.25}
