We begin with a survey of different mechanisms of cellular signalling and their roles in \u0027normal\u0027 cellular activities and overall homeostasis. A diverse set of cellular processes is studied and the normal control mechanisms highlighted. This is followed by investigation of the dysfunction of signalling mechanisms in several disease states. Topics covered are: the cell cycle, apoptosis, haematopoiesis, atherosclerosis and HIV/AIDS. The aim is to demonstrate to students that dysfunction or inappropriate cellular signalling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of many common disease. Methods of clinical diagnosis are introduced and incorporated into the laboratory work, which is designed to illustrate concepts of the theory.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BTH3741","eftsl":0.125}
