Migration between software and hardware will be considered as an approach to meet design criterion such as speed, throughput, energy usage and cost.The design, analysis and implementation of real-time operating systems will be studied and will include scheduling policies, process creation and management, inter-process communication and synchronisation, efficient handling of I/O and communication.Students will complete a major team design project that includes hardware and software design of a real-time system.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE5881","eftsl":0.125}
