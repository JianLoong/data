The structures, properties and common reactions of classes of organic compounds will be investigated along with the structures and reactivities of coordination complexes.  Aspects of physical chemistry including thermodynamics, kinetics and solution equilibria and electrochemistry will be studied in some detail. The interrelationship of these topics will be explored ultimately leading to the ability to predict reaction directionality in different reactions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHM1752","eftsl":0.125}
