This unit provides a practical introduction to methods suitable for forecasting in these circumstances including the classical decomposition of time series, exponential smoothing, Box-Jenkins ARIMA modelling, and regression with auto-correlated disturbances. It also provides an introduction to applied multiple regression analysis. Students can expect to enhance their computer skills with exercises using advanced features of Microsoft Excel and an econometrics package.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETC2450","eftsl":0.125}
