It extends the knowledge students have in relation to imaging pathology into the field of image interpretation. The unit will provide students with a detailed consideration of the psychophysics underpinning visual perception and the phenomenon of pattern recognition. The unit will address the radiographic interpretation of skeletal disease and skeletal trauma and the  chest and abdomen including issues around the complexity of interpreting the radiographic patterns associated with injuries to the spine. The unit will provide the opportunity for students to reinforce their existing knowledge related to normal anatomy and normal variants and the growing bone and the mature skeleton on general radiographic images. Finally, the unit will require students to reflect upon their current clinical decision making processes and extend these processes into the area of general radiography commenting and the concept of the radiographer health assessment.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD4502","eftsl":0.125}
