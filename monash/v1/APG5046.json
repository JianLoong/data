In essence, this unit provides a technical foundation for later work in applied areas of the discipline. It explores areas such as the sounds of speech (phonetics and phonology), what makes a sentence grammatically correct (morphology and syntax) and how we derive meaning from utterances (semantics and pragmatics). The unit enhances students\u0027 knowledge of the workings of English and also introduces students to data from a range of other languages for the purposes of comparison.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5046","eftsl":0.25}
