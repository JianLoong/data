The learning is structured around evidence-based practice and the development of practice-based evidence for common issues in both adult and child populations. Students examine both client and therapist variables that have been identified as essential for intervention efficacy and are exposed to a range of techniques associated with promotion of wellbeing, symptom reduction and behavioural change. In addition, students learn how to employ culturally sensitive interventions that have been shown to facilitate positive outcomes in a variety of contexts. Research methodologies employed in the establishment of evidence-based practice are critiqued. Students learn how to utilise research in guiding their choice of therapeutic interventions and how to study the outcomes of their intervention in practice. The unit also provides guided rehearsal and development of skills relating to general professional psychological practice.","enjoyResponse":20,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5516","eftsl":0.25}
