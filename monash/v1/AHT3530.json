The Baroque themes of spectacle, trompe l\u0027oeil excess, and incorporeal experience will be examined with reference to the visual arts from Caravaggio to Borromini. The return of these preoccupations in contemporary art and media will also be explored. Key historical and theoretical topics, such as the status of illusionism  and narrative in art, the representation of spirituality, sexuality and death, and the recent \u0027remediation\u0027of earlier visual forms and ideas will be emphasized.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT3530","eftsl":0.125}
