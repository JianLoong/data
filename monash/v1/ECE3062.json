MOS and BJT single ended as well as differential amplifier circuits, along with basic analogue circuit blocks like the current mirror, are introduced and developed using small signal models.  Practical Operational Amplifiers are considered where properties deviate from ideal in terms of frequency response, CMMR, noise, stability and input/output impedance.  The use of feedback in electronic circuits is studied, and ways to improve arising stability issues in operational amplifiers (eg using pole compensation) are discussed.  Nyquist is presented and frequency domain analysis and design shall be explicitly explored via Bode plots. Concepts of State Space representation, transfer functions, canonical realisation, observability and controllability and discrete-time systems are presented.","enjoyResponse":72,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3062","eftsl":0.125}
