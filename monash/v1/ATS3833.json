It investigates the processes involved in writing and creating performance works and performance texts of those works. Various strategies of initiating new work, including the possibilities of various sites and modes of performance, will be explored. Students will work under guidance to take these projects to public presentation standard. Students will then write either a performance text of the work they have created or an analysis of the writing/ performance project. To contextualise the chosen investigations there will be a weekly programme of readings, discussions and class presentations.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3833","eftsl":0.125}
