It will start with an introduction to axiomatic set theory and highlight that almost all mathematical concepts of interest to economists can be thought of assets or subsets of suitably defined sets. The three main mathematical structured sets to be covered will be sets with an order structure, topological structure, and linear structure. The six main topics will be Set Theory, Metric and Topological Spaces, Properties of Functions and Correspondences, Linear and Normed Linear Spaces, Fixed Point and Separating Hyperplane Theorems, and a brief introduction to Static and Dynamic Optimization.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ECC5850","eftsl":0.125}
