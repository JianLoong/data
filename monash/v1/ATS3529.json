Initially, the course will explore traditional theoretical constructions of nationalism before considering the contemporary reconfiguring of nationalism. This reconfiguring will be performed in relation to discourses such as policy arrangements in relation to political machinations, auteur constructions, traditions of landscape cinema, race relations, multiculturalism, beach culture, the social, globalism, marketing, distribution, gender and criticism. The unit will employ feature, documentary and short film and television examples as well as contemporary and archival audio-visual texts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3529","eftsl":0.125}
