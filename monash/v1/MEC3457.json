Mechanical, electrical, fluid pressure devices and complete elementary control systems are included. Orientation is to predicting, examining and assessing system performance via formation of mathematical models and solution of models. Laboratory experiments and hands-on instruction in the digital simulation package Matlab to solve models. A unified approach to mathematical modelling via the concepts of resistance, capacitance and inertia/inductance is emphasised. Students learn to perform system modelling, develop solution, assess a system response and analyse systems.","enjoyResponse":105,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC3457","eftsl":0.125}
