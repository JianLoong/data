Radiographic knowledge will be extended to enable examinations of the respiratory system, shoulder and pelvic girdles, the vertebral column, the bony thorax and plain abdomen to be safely performed. Building on earlier principles of professional practice, RAD1012 will introduce the science required for more advanced radiographic equipment operation. Radiation dosimetry and safety is also studied so that competent operation and performance measurement of diagnostic ionising radiation equipment may be executed. Clinical exposure to patients under supervision will enable the student to apply these principles across the range of examinations indicated.","enjoyResponse":28,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD1012","eftsl":0.375}
