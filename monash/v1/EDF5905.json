The unit investigates a range of modes of communication (multiliteracies) to tease out the knowledge processes of experiencing, conceptualising, analysing and applying knowledge. This includes reference to music, movement, dance, storytelling, visual arts, media and drama, as well as talking, viewing, reading and writing as multiple literacy forms. The unit also covers early numeracy concepts, numbers, mathematical thinking, reasoning, measurement, patterns, spatial awareness, problem solving, collection and analysis of data and how these link to the demands of learning at school, work, home and community. Students understand how to build children\u0027s communicative intentions, confidence and capacity. They apply approaches to expand children\u0027s literacy and numeracy concepts to enable creative and critical interactions across a range of modes and digital settings.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5905","eftsl":0.25}
