Although this unit is entirely suitable for a future developer of e-Business Systems, it is optimally targeted at future managers of such development. Thus practical exercises will be illustrative rather than industrial strength and technology issues will be given equal coverage with technology details. The primary aim of the unit is to familiarise students with as many of the currently popular e-Business technologies as possible so that their design and implementation decisions in the future will be informed and therefore produce successful systems with a high degree of probability.","enjoyResponse":44,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3083","eftsl":0.125}
