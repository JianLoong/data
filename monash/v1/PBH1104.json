We explore their underlying causes including: globalisation, transnational trade, tourism, rapid development, social and political transitions, climate change, violence and insecurity. Using research reports and field experience from practical projects, we examine the wider context for working in international settings as well as the issues faced by Indigenous peoples, migrants and refugees. We explore our responsibilities as \u0027global citizens\u0027 and we challenge you to think about ways you could make a difference.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PBH1104","eftsl":0.125}
