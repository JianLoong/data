The topics include study of materials used in organic electronics and MEMS, study of their electrical and mechanical properties, basic structures in micro devices such as cantilever beams and comb structures, the fabrication techniques involved in manufacturing micro and nano structures, and measurement techniques suitable for characterizing  micro devices. Examples will include principles of physical sensors; piezoelectric effect based microsensors; chemical microsensors; OLED devices; MEMS and microsystems computer based simulations. An elementary part of the unit will be the laboratory exercises and project work to produce micro devices and construct suitable electronic circuits/simulate to demonstrate their applications.","enjoyResponse":34,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4808","eftsl":0.125}
