Students will be exposed to a broad range of creative communication processes from print to digital media, and will be able to identify the appropriate context(s) to which they would be applied independently and in conjunction with one another.Students will explore a range of media elements including typography, image, layout, three-dimensional form, sound and motion as core components to their communication design solutions. Studio-based projects across both print and digital media platforms will develop skills in narrative structure, typography, image construction and manipulation, production methods and technologies, and the planning and management of design outcomes.Students will be encouraged to approach all projects with an open attitude to experimentation and critical enquiry. Studies in this unit will help students develop an understanding of the vital space communication designers occupy in developing and contributing to the language of contemporary visual culture, alongside the social responsibilities inherently associated with this.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"CDS2001","eftsl":0.25}
