In this placement they will consider their own role within human service organizations and apply and critique contemporary practice knowledge in leadership and management, supervision and mentoring, organizational behaviour, change management, organizational governance and service quality, professional development, and complex, program based multidisciplinary teams. A learning contract developed in OCC5070 will be used to guide fieldwork learning. Fieldwork provides students with the opportunity to develop, integrate and enhance their practice skills to reach an entry level of competence in occupational therapy prior to graduation. By the end of the fieldwork placement, students will be managing a caseload of clients independently. A portfolio assessment will be used to encourage reflection, a self-directed approach to learning and to provide a record of professional competencies as these are developing.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"OCC5080","eftsl":0.25}
