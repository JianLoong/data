The study of motor control and skill acquisition is a broad area that uses foundational biophysical knowledge together with elements of psychology, sociology and understanding of growth and development to explore how and why the human body moves. Students are introduced to concepts such as tacit knowledge and environmental constraints to understand the dynamic interaction between body and environment in the production of high-level skilled sporting and lifetime physical activity movements. The unit also investigates how movement abilities can be diverse due to a range of factors beyond the immediate control of the individual. Students develop a theoretical foundation to underpin many practical approaches common to sports coaching and movement settings. Practical application of theoretical understandings provides students with an appreciation for how they might plan for, implement and evaluate a range of approaches to learning motor skills.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2171","eftsl":0.125}
