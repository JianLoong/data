It extends the basic work covered in CIV3221 Building Structures and Technology regarding matrix analysis and includes the theoretical basis and application of the finite element method.The syllabus covers matrix analysis for truss and beam structures and finite element analysis for truss, beam and plate elements. Computer packages such as ABAQUS will be introduced to perform static stress, dynamic response and buckling analyses. Comparison between hand calculations and predictions from computer analyses are made wherever practicable.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV4234","eftsl":0.125}
