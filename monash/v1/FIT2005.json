The key disciplines of the Unified Process will be examined to set a context for analysis and design. Students will learn about static and dynamic modelling, and component-based design, using UML. Some common design patterns will be studied. Some topics about software architecture are examined.The unit prepares students to be able to design large systems such as will be implemented in their final year project unit or after graduation.","enjoyResponse":22,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT2005","eftsl":0.125}
