The unit prepares students to develop a constructivist approach to teaching science, incorporating strategies such as connecting to children\u0027s prior knowledge, questioning and inquiry learning, hands-on approaches, scientific investigations and learner-owned/learner-centred investigations. The relationship among science, technology and society is explored, and the nature of science as a discipline is considered. Students build understanding of and demonstrate capacities to plan for science learning and teaching related to the Victorian and Australian curriculum from Foundation to Year 8.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2214","eftsl":0.125}
