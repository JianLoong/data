Topics include catalysis in synthesis, radical chemistry, organometallic chemistry, heterocyclic chemistry, reactive intermediates and stereochemistry, as well as retrosynthetic analysis. An understanding of reaction mechanisms will be emphasized throughout. The practical component reinforces aspects of the lecture course with laboratory experience.This will involve: catalysis and biocatalysis organometallic reactions radical reactions heterocyclic chemistry asymmetric synthesis reactive Intermediates","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC3121","eftsl":0.125}
