Advances in polymer synthesis, processing and engineering have led to new applications exploiting the unique properties of polymers to realise advanced technologies far removed from their initial application.Building on a review of the fundamentals of polymer science, this unit will explore the use of polymers in a range of novel applications from biomedical applications to optoelectronic devices. Different classes of polymers will be discussed including conjugated polymers, block co-polymers and biopolymers with a view to linking the physical properties of the polymer chain to the functionality of the technological application.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE5882","eftsl":0.125}
