It discusses economic interdependence notions and gains from trade and globalisation with application to South Africa and the African continent; the role of institutions in promoting and facilitating these concepts in the international economy; theories of trade, incorporating notions of absolute and comparative advantage; modern trade theory and its extensions; empirical evidence with respect to Africa which highlight trade theory strengths and limitations; investigation and analysis of welfare effects of trade, using both theory and evidence to answer contentious concerns whether trade make the poor even poorer; whether trade restrictions necessary to protect jobs; and whether larger trade benefits accrue to developed countries more than developing countries; as well as regional integration in Africa.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ECS5921","eftsl":0.125}
