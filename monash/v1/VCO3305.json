Students become familiar with the potentiality and limitations of specific font software packages and learn how to achieve high quality results. This is a highly specialised area of computer-generated typography and offers students the opportunity to be in the forefront of font development. Questions of legibility and the challenging of traditional methods of conveying messages through typography are addressed, discussed and debated.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VCO3305","eftsl":0.125}
