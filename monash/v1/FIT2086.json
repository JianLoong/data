It covers: Data: collection and sampling, data quality. Analytic tasks: statistical hypothesis testing, introductory decision theory, exploratory and confirmatory analysis. Probability distributions: multivariate Gaussian, Poisson, Dirichlet, linear and logistic regression, random number generation and simulation of distributions, simulation of samples (bootstrap). Estimation: parameter and function estimation, maximum likelihood and minimum cost estimators, Monte Carlo estimators, inverse probabilities and Bayes theorem, bias versus variance and sample size effects, cross validation. Information Theory: information and entropy, data coding and compression, entropy and likelihood, relative entropy and correlation, bounds and limits. Dependence models: Markov model, Bayesian and Markov network, log-linear model. Modelling: hypothesis testing, inference, and optimal decisions, predictive versus generative modelling, experts and assessing probabilities and models.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT2086","eftsl":0.125}
