Students will engage in projects of growing complexity that have multiple approaches and potential outcomes. The students build upon their prior experience of the design process to discover, define, create and demonstrate their design ability in a interdisciplinary way. They will develop designs to a stage that allows reflective critical analysis. Students will be expected to demonstrate a strong capability to resolve and defend their designs. Students will be encouraged to engage with topics that drawn from the research agenda of the Faculty and Department of Design. This enables the integration of staff research with the educational aspirations of the unit. Students are therefore exposed to an advanced knowledge in particular areas, and areas in which to engage their own growing skill sets.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC5230","eftsl":0.25}
