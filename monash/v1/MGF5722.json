Using a political economy approach, the unit will provide a comparative perspective on Brazil, Russia, China, India and South Africa also known as the BRICS. Over the past ten years the geo-political and economic importance of the BRICS has been increasing. While they have been advocating for a stronger voice in major international institutions such as the WTO, the World Bank and the IMF, the BRICS do not have a common identity and their influence and power at the global level is uneven. This unit covers the history of the BRICS as well as the political, economic, security and foreign policy trends in these countries. It provides different perspectives on the power of the BRICS in an international context and focuses on the challenges they face. Particular attention is given to the thematic areas of international trade, international finance, the environment, global health and food security.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGF5722","eftsl":0.125}
