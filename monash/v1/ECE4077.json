Numerical libraries based upon modern meta-programming techniques are introduced to show ways of constructing performance-critical software to solve engineering problems that are formulated as partial differential equations. Due to their widespread usage, special emphasis will be placed on constructing numerical solutions based on finite difference and finite element methods. Specifically, this unit will extensively use advanced C++ language features and numerical libraries such as Blitz++.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4077","eftsl":0.125}
