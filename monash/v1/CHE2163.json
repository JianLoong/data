Develop an understanding of the mechanisms and mathematical representation of conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer and convective mass transfer. Gain an appreciation for the analogies between heat and mass transfer using dimensional analysis. Understand and apply concepts of local and overall heat and mass transfer coefficients including boiling heat transfer to simple problems. Calculation of overall heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer area using Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) and Number of Transfer Unit (NTU) method. Gain an understanding of molecular diffusion in gases, solids, and liquids and develop methods to use these concepts in problem solving. Perform experiments to illustrate the concepts of heat and mass transfer.","enjoyResponse":114,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE2163","eftsl":0.125}
