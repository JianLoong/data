Building on EDF5169 (Outdoor education in the secondary years A), the unit further develops students\u0027 knowledge and understanding of the history of outdoor education curriculum in Australia and other countries and introduces them to relevant policy in these areas. Working collaboratively and independently, students consider how historical factors and current policy shape contemporary curriculum, professional practices and student learning. Students reflect critically upon their experiences of planning for and teaching outdoor education, and they develop their capacity to undertake limited research into outdoor education. This combination of activity enables them  to develop and refine their educational philosophy, their leadership capacities and their abilities to meet the diverse educational needs of students in secondary school outdoor education programs.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5170","eftsl":0.125}
