Levels of health program evaluation, including formative, process, impact, and outcome evaluation, will be examined. The range of qualitative and quantitative methods that are appropriate for different evaluation questions will be presented. An emphasis will be placed on the evaluation challenges posed by the complexities of health promotion and the contexts in which it is carried out, with case studies used to illustrate these issues. Evaluation design and data collection options to strengthen knowledge of program impact will be explored.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"HSC3061","eftsl":0.125}
