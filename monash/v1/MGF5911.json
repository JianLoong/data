Diplomacy as the art of persuasion is therefore an integral part of foreign policy. Just as democracy has transformed the domestic political environment of many countries since the eighteenth century, self-determination has transformed the international political environment in the twentieth century. The two traditions in statecraft -- one moral and universalist, one pragmatic and promoting the \u0027national interest\u0027 -- are tested in the context of bilateral, regional and multilateral modern diplomacy. Case studies in the Asia-Pacific and the challenges facing foreign policy.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGF5911","eftsl":0.125}
