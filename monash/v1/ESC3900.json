This unit examines a number of geologically-significant events, including: the formation of the crust, mantle, and core; evolution of the atmosphere and biosphere; supercontinent formation; Snowball Earth; changes to global weathering; and eruption of Large Igneous Provinces. Evidence for these events in the rock record and their impacts on the biosphere and atmosphere will be assessed. The unit will also highlight uncertainties and competing theories that relate to these geological episodes.","enjoyResponse":14,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ESC3900","eftsl":0.125}
