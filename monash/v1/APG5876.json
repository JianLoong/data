It addresses questions and areas such as methodological principles for researching and writing theory-related research papers, including an overview of research and research discussions and initiatives taking place in the field. Its specific focus is on: cultural issues which must be taken into consideration when translating, aspects of cultural competence (pragmatic and semiotic differences between cultures), and the related issue of equivalence. Ideal translator competence implies a sensitivity to and knowledge of cultural issues which impinge upon translation practice, including mode of discourse, medium, and cultural-specific codes.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5876","eftsl":0.25}
