This unit explores the concept of genre, remaking  and adaptation in relation to a selection of contemporary and historical film and television texts. This unit describes genre as a complex situation that is enabled and limited by the related roles and practices of industry, critics and audiences. This understanding of genre is developed through three broad approaches to genre as: industrial category-deals with issues of production, including commerce and authorship; textual category, considers plots and structures; critical category, investigates issues of reception, audiences and institutions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2530","eftsl":0.125}
