The course is in three parts. In the first part, the basic building blocks of: the concepts of credit; how a company borrows money; and how it gives security to its lenders to secure repayment, are all examined. The second part involves an examination of the various forms of borrowings, including syndicated financing and project finance. The third part deals with borrowing in the capital markets (that is, without involving a bank as a lender), both domestically in Australia and internationally. The course is principally focused on how Australian companies borrow money both in Australia and in other international markets. The course deals with Australian law and also English and European law and US tax and regulation in so far as they affect Australian companies accessing the international markets. An understanding of common law contract law is assumed and some understanding of company law would be of benefit but is not required.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5419","eftsl":0.125}
