Key international documents that SRHR concepts are drawn from include gender-specific texts such as: the International Conference on Population and Development, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Beijing Platform for Action, UN Millennium Development Goals and The Yogyakarta Principles (The Application of Human Rights Law, in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity). The unit covers topics across multidisciplinary fields of study and diverse social-cultural contexts, such as: bodily integrity, gender-based violence, genders and sexualities, HIV and AIDS and reproductive justice. The unit also explores the cross-cutting nature of SRHR in less researched areas of concern, such as, poverty, food sovereignty, security and disaster, climate justice, labour and migration and political and religious fundamentalisms.The unit aims to enable students to critically engage with highly contemporary debates on SRHR, particularly on how it impacts youth and adolescents and to make informed and reflexive decisions on SRHR matters in their own lives. It also enables students to understand broader implications of SRHR in terms of synergising local practices and global visions.","enjoyResponse":21,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMU2907","eftsl":0.125}
