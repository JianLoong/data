These equations appear in a number of physical models, such as oscillations, heat conduction and transport equations. Methods to study ordinary differential equations include separation of variables, substituting methods, variation of parameters, series solutions and numerical techniques (Euler, Heun\u0027s method). Partial differential equations describing physical models are derived, and analysed through Fourier series, separation of variables and characteristics techniques.","enjoyResponse":98,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MTH2032","eftsl":0.125}
