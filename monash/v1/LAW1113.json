Students examine the intentional torts of false imprisonment and, trespass to land, the strict liability tort of and nuisance, and the unintentional tort of negligence. There is a detailed study of the elements of the tort of negligence - namely, duty of care, breach of duty, causation, defences and the assessment of damages - and the particular problems raised by negligently caused mental harm and pure economic loss. Students will also consider the principles and rationale of vicarious liability. Throughout the unit, students will explore the impact of statutory law reform, in particular the civil liability reforms, on torts law, in the broader context of how civil wrongs should be redressed.","enjoyResponse":139,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW1113","eftsl":0.125}
