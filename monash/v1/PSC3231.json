On successful completion of this unit and PSC3211 (co-requisite), students will have developed a systematic approach to experimentation that includes the creation and application of their own suite of documents and scientific templates (assignments) that are relevant in all contexts involving new product development. They will also develop the critical thinking skills necessary in the process of making professional informed decisions about the design of a scientific investigation as well as in the interpretation and communication of results that will improve their employability.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC3231","eftsl":0.125}
