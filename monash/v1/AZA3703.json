Three themes are addressed. First - general issues involved in efforts to manage and stop the arms race are introduced. Second - attempts to restrain the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, biological weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are outlined analysed. The role of South Africa as a world leader in nuclear non-proliferation efforts will be highlighted, as well as the position of Africa in the global nuclear regime. Third - the prospects for various degrees of demilitarisation are discussed in the light of contemporary developments in world politics. Here, specific emphasis will be placed on the challenges of disarmament in Africa.","enjoyResponse":22,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3703","eftsl":0.125}
