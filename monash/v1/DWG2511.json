Students will work from anatomical specimens (including prosected cadavers) at the Anatomical Museum and various forms of diagrammatic representation of the body. Through a variety of media and methodologies, the students explore how to make sense of the form and structure of the body, drawing on perceptual, observational and conceptual drawing strategies; as well as contemporary issues regarding the body found in critical theory. The unit will also address the OHS and ethical issues required for study in this area.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DWG2511","eftsl":0.125}
