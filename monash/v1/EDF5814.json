Students learn about the growing discourses of arts-based research, such as video, performance, ethnodrama and computer-mediated arts methods. Using this knowledge, students design and implement a small project. They work collaboratively to develop their project with an organisation of relevance to them. They are encouraged to critically examine the links between creativity, building community and social inclusion. No previous experience or expertise in the arts is required to participate and excel in this unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5814","eftsl":0.25}
