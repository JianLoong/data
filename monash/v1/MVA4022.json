Discussions identify relationships between intuitive, artistic intentions and the principles of objectivity which inform investigative method in non-artistic disciplines. The result of this unit is a \u0027paper\u0027, arguing for either the rightness of the proposal, its need for change, the rightness of the artistic means for achieving it or the need for revision of those means. The paper is not an exegetical document of the visual work: rather, it assists in documenting the rationale for the visual work against a backdrop of critical challenge.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MVA4022","eftsl":0.125}
