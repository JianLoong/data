The unit will help students to write effective essays at a tertiary level. There is a particular focus on how academic writing presents clear reasoning with evidence to support a position, and how the academic essay differs from other  types of non-fiction writing, such as the opinion piece.  Students will learn key principles of grammar and academic style conventions, as well as how to use sources correctly (finding, referencing, quoting, and paraphrasing) and avoid problems of plagiarism.  Students will also learn how to plan, research, edit, and proofread essays to a high standard .","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1297","eftsl":0.125}
