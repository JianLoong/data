Students develop their experiential knowledge and skills in outdoor education environments and educational contexts and develop techniques for planning, managing and evaluating learning programs and the ability to apply, question, test and consolidate theories and concepts explored in EDF2175. These experiences also provide students with the opportunity to build competencies in the professional requirements associated with fieldwork provision in outdoor education and environmental studies; that is, in the conduct of outdoor activities, safe planning, risk management and experience in the logistical support required for the provision of fieldwork programs.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2103","eftsl":0}
