It covers public transportation planning from a range of perspectives including policy, demand/markets and supply/operations and infrastructure. Policy analysis is designed to provide an understanding of the strategic, institutional and political context within which public transportation services are provided. This is to illustrate the diverse and often conflicting objectives which drive the development and planning of services. Demand/market analysis aims to introduce students to the range of markets and market drivers which influence the use of public transportation services. Supply/operations and infrastructure analysis provides an overview of the types of services which are provided and the operational, engineering and technology issues which govern their effective deployment.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV5322","eftsl":0.125}
