The emphasis throughout is on reading history across different periods and places in order to appreciate the strategies used in the writing of history. A variety of styles and genres of historical writing will be studied, in order to analyse some of the key elements of historical prose, such as story-telling, scene-setting, characterisation, placing oneself in the text, documentation and the onus of proof. The unit also encourages self-conscious reflection about style, prose and voice, and has workshops designed to improve and extend students own experience of writing history.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4301","eftsl":0.25}
