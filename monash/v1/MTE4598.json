It will cover methods for the determination of atomic structure, chemical composition and bonding, 3D structures, surface morphology and topography, orientation-relationships and electronic and magnetic structures. These methods will be illustrated with applications, for example, to nanomaterials, alloys, ceramics, catalysts, polymers and electronic materials. The course will cover the theory, methodology and application of both scanning and transmission electron microscopy and will incorporate practical sessions in front of electron microscopes.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4598","eftsl":0.125}
