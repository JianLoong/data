There is a focus on content in the statistics and probability strand of the Australian Curriculum. Students consolidate and synthesise their learning to critically reflect on activities and approaches for developing understanding, fluency, problem-solving and reasoning capacities associated with chance, data representation and data presentation. Students engage with research on how students learn and develop strategies for addressing more complex learning needs, including differentiating learning tasks, setting challenging tasks for more able children, and designing authentic learning projects that promote integrated learning. Students also develop their own numeracy skills essential for being a teacher and locate sources of professional learning for teachers of mathematics.","enjoyResponse":45,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4267","eftsl":0.125}
