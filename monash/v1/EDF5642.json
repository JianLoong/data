Students examine the development and maintenance of bilingualism and biliteracy in formal learning environments. Sociolinguistic, psycholinguistic, political and educational aspects of content-based and immersion programs are explored in local and global contexts. The unit covers a range of approaches, including Content-Based Language Teaching (CBLT), Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and the Canadian immersion models in primary, secondary and vocational education settings. Key policies and documents related to curriculum development and practice are investigated with a focus on the pedagogical implications of additional language/literacy teaching and first language development. Connections are made between research and pedagogy including recent bilingual instructional strategies such as translanguaging.","enjoyResponse":52,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5642","eftsl":0.25}
