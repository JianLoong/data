Concepts of leadership and management are examined for their distinctiveness and limitations. A number of models of leadership are introduced which highlight personal attributes and approaches to leadership practice, and consider how leadership may be understood from an organisational perspective, including distributed views of organisational leadership and cognition, and emerging conceptions of leadership practice in the context of complexity and sustainability. Participants also gain an appreciation of leadership development, identities, ethics and values, and emotions.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5670","eftsl":0.25}
