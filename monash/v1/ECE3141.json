After introducing concepts of block and stream delivery, requirements of a telecommunications network and representation of analogue signals (e.g. voice and video) in digital form, the unit will cover all the major functions in layered architectures. Topics to be covered include multiplexing, basic line transmission and modulation, error protection and correction, packet switching, LAN protocols and the TCP/IP protocols on which the Internet is built. Particular emphasis is given to the major functions that combine to allow communication across key modern digital telecommunication systems such as the Internet, mobile telephony, digital TV and Digital Audio Broadcasting.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3141","eftsl":0.125}
