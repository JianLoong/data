In a contemporary world that frames these relations as a \u0027clash of civilisations,\u0027 the course retraces the shifting relationships between the three monotheistic traditions, emphasising Jewish life in the medieval period under Christian and Islamic rule. We will start this course with the foundational texts of the three monotheistic religions, examining how these societies defined themselves and others. Moving to the medieval period we will explore the interactions between Christians, Jews and Muslims-the shared texts, spaces, and intellectual ideas that united all three societies. Even in moments of extreme violence, we see evidence of coexistence alongside conflict.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1322","eftsl":0.125}
