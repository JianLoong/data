The central feature of both Yiddish 3A and 3B will be the more advanced teaching of Yiddish as a living language, as a tool for both written and spoken communication. The course is designed for students who wish to improve their knowledge of the subject both in its literary and conversational form. The course will include use of non-literary texts and exercises to develop grammatical, syntactic and idiomatic mastery of the language. An additional component will utilise Yiddish literary texts of Australia as well as of other countries. Completion of parts A and B will prepare students to complete a major in the subject.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3815","eftsl":0.125}
