Students develop understanding of what legislative requirements must be met, e.g. ensuring students\u0027 wellbeing and safety, anti-discrimination and equity laws. They explore how policies can impact on meeting diverse learners\u0027 needs and how they can be supported to ensure social justice, inclusion and equity for students from varied linguistic, cultural, religious and socio-economic backgrounds. Students examine the Melbourne Declaration on the Educational Goals for Young Australians and other federal and state policies that aim to develop curriculum and practice emphases in line with key priorities for education in Australia. Students also examine how a range of policies (including the cross-curriculum priority areas: developing understanding of and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, histories, cultures and learner needs, developing education for sustainability, studies of Asia and the ethical use of information and communication technologies) are enacted at the school and classroom levels.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3210","eftsl":0.125}
