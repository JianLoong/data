Among the issues that concern the stoics and epicureans are questions about happiness and fulfilment; coping with the inevitability of death; fatalism and moral responsibility; and the role and relevance of god in a purely material universe. A proper understanding of the truths revealed by the systems was thought to make the fully educated stoic or epicurean \u0027a mortal god\u0027-blessed and happy, utterly immune to the vagaries of misfortune and fearless in the face of death.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3885","eftsl":0.125}
