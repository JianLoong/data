Behaviour is examined from the individual, group and organisational levels. The study of individual behaviour moves from consideration of personality and perception to values and attitudes and motivation. Group behaviour examines topics such as group structure and properties, group and team behaviour and leadership. These two areas of behaviour are then brought together to provide insight into the complex areas of organisational analysis (including structure and design and culture) as well as organisational processes. This multi-level organisational perspective develops student understanding and appreciation of current debates surrounding topics such as ethics and corporate social responsibility, power and influence and stress management.","enjoyResponse":14,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGF5960","eftsl":0.125}
