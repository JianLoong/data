Students will design experimental protocols; appreciating the importance of experimental and quality controls in research design and linkingpractical findings with clinical problems. The course is laboratory based, incorporating in-class tutorial sessions covering theoretical aspects of the content. Students will choose an emerging area of research, design experiments that could investigate this research and present this in a range of research settings.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"IMM3062","eftsl":0.125}
