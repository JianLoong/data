The rheology of polymers are discussed and the factors controlling viscosity are described and related to polymer processing. The thermodynamics of polymer blends and the resulting morphology is related to the mechanical properties. The wide range of polymer additives is reviewed. For composite materials, the types of matrices and fibres/fillers are described as well as composite fabrication and the effect of reinforcement on properties. Designing with polymers and materials selection for properties and applications is studied in detail.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4572","eftsl":0.125}
