Topics covered include the likelihood principle and maximum likelihood estimation; minimum variance unbiased estimation; maximum likelihood asymptotic distribution theory; likelihood-based hypothesis testing; and quasi-maximum likelihood inference. The theoretical developments are supplemented by numerical results produced using computer simulation. Consideration is also given to the numerical optimisation techniques used to implement likelihood-based procedures in practice.","enjoyResponse":25,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETC3400","eftsl":0.125}
