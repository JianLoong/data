It allows students to translate the real-world treatment of initial flaws and crack growth data to an abstract form for structural modelling. The unit aims to develop an understanding of the application of fracture mechanics in airworthiness applications and students will gain knowledge of the role of inspection intervals, residual strength and in-service crack growth, to the through-life support of aircraft.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5404","eftsl":0.125}
