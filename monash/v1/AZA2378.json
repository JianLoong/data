It also provides a historical contextualisation and understanding relationships between the \u0027north\u0027 and \u0027south\u0027 in contemporary globalisation from an African viewpoint. The unit uses anthropology to help understand social and economic patterns of change; how development policy is imagined, produced, and received (or resisted) across multiple cultural contexts; and how development is imagined and defined through specific case studies (including African case studies) of approaches, institutions and practitioners in the field.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA2378","eftsl":0.125}
