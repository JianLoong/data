Particular attention will be devoted to the Bible as an expression of the religious life and thought of ancient Israel. Topics examined include an exploration of the core beliefs of the Bible regarding creation, revelation and redemption, and the problem of evil and suffering, as well as conceptions of divinity, prophecy, law and cult. The art of biblical narrative and poetry will also be explored, as will issues of authorship and canonisation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2185","eftsl":0.125}
