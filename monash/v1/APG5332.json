Central to the debates around security are issues of power, language, discourse and subjectivity; who/what is to be \u0027secured\u0027, by what means? The unit covers a broad range of topics around traditional realist and critical conceptualisations of security, with particular focus on the Copenhagen and Aberystwyth Schools, Postcolonial and Feminist Security Studies. The conceptual understandings of security and the articulation of \u0027threats\u0027 will be further applied to specific case studies for a deeper engagement.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5332","eftsl":0.25}
