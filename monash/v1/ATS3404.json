Through an examination of prescribed texts and visual material, the unit will analyse the body and erotic desire in the Classical world. It will look at erotic poetry, the cultural context of medical literature, the eroticisation of the Hellenistic novel, the rhetorical and political use of gender politics, and the culture of corporeal abnegation fostered by the early Christian church. Specific focus will also be given to literary and iconographic representation of the suffering body as a site/sight of entertainment and deterrent.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3404","eftsl":0.125}
