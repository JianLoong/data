Students gain critical insight into key forms of reporting that raise issues of advocacy, agency and accountability, including environmental journalism, peace and development reporting, and public journalism. By exploring the rationale behind each, students learn to approach news not as a series of discrete violent events but rather as part of complex, ongoing processes of social and environmental change. Drawing on case studies, theory and practical research techniques, students will evaluate gate-keeping decisions while producing in-depth investigations of their own.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3645","eftsl":0.125}
