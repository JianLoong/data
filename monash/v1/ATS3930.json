This unit explores how encounters between Europe and the world were transformed from the tentative and uncertain contacts that characterised earlier periods to the self-confident imperialism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Rather than analysing the broad sweep of political history, we are interested in the leading edge of cross-cultural encounters: in travellers, diplomats, and slaves who \u0027crossed-over\u0027 to engage with new cultural worlds, in the tools that made these encounters possible and in the commodities that underpinned global exchange.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3930","eftsl":0.125}
