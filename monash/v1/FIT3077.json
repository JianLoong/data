It provides the professional software engineer with advanced knowledge and skills in high-level architectural design, its theoretical foundations, industrial best practice, and relevant application context. In the software life-cycle, software architecture sits between analysis/specification and design/implementation. The field of software architecture has come of age with a thriving research community and numerous high-level models, methods, tools and practices widely used in industry.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3077","eftsl":0.125}
