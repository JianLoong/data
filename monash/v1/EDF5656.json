A key focus of this unit is on the education of learners with disabilities. This unit addresses the reasons that such learners are excluded and identifies what can be done to enhance their participation in different contexts. This includes how we undertake authentic assessment so that everyone is included across different learning and social contexts. It also focuses on evidence-based strategies which could be applied to ensure that everyone is fully included in educational, social and physical activities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5656","eftsl":0.25}
