Students will develop conceptual frameworks that can be applied in the range of contexts they are likely to encounter through their career. They will also be given insight into how these fundamental principles and theories contribute to the development of successful marketing strategies and tactics. Students will study the theories and implications of consumer behaviour and will gain a strong understanding of the role of the brand in delivering value to the customer and value to the organisation. These insights will help students develop an understanding of the role and value of the marketing function within an organisation. The unit will also provide students with a perspective that shows the usefulness of basic marketing conceptual models in their further study and their future careers.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MKF5917","eftsl":0.125}
