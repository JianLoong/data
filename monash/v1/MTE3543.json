Metal forming will be linked to the factors that control formability, with yield/failure criteria and constitutive behaviour being examined. Students will engage in finite element analysis of metal processing. Material behaviour from microstructure to applications will be considered for both traditional metal forming and more advanced shaping processes such as additive manufacturing of metals. Microstructural features governing fatigue, fracture and failure of structures will be explored and the extent to which we can predict failure outlined, including design against failure, critical crack size, low and high cycle fatigue. Microstructural toughening, effects of welds and thermal stability of materials will be addressed in terms of mitigation or minimization of structural defects.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE3543","eftsl":0.125}
