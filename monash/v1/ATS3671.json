Case studies drawn from a wide variety of cultures will provide opportunities to examine language use in light of broader cultural, political and social issues such as stereotyping and discriminatory language, cultural expectation and attitudes, cultural awareness training, language reform and policies.","enjoyResponse":17,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3671","eftsl":0.125}
