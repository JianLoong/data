All materials are assumed to be granular and frictional. The unit includes the analysis and design of slopes, shallow and deep foundations, retaining walls, and pavements. Effective stresses only are used. Visualisation is developed through the mapping and modelling exercise. A clear emphasis on sustainable design will be made.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG2206","eftsl":0.125}
