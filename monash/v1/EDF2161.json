Although numeracy is sometimes thought of as a subset of mathematics, it can also be seen as encompassing a different set of aims and objectives. For example, the power of \u0027pure\u0027 mathematics can be thought of as resting in the pleasure that mathematicians gain from \u0027playing\u0027 with mathematics for its own sake, and the resultant ever more abstract nature of the subject. In contrast, being numerate means working in the opposite direction: looking for the mathematics potentially \u0027hidden\u0027 in the world and drawing on quantitative skills to question particular issues. Numeracy is linked to being able to make critically informed judgements, judgements for which mathematical knowledge in itself may not equip one. By addressing such issues the unit develops both students\u0027 understanding of numeracy and mathematics and what this means for them as teachers and future leaders of numeracy in schools.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2161","eftsl":0.125}
