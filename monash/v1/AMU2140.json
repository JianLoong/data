Students will be introduced to both classic texts and recent research dealing with the impact of political forces and processes on economic policies and outcomes.  No background in economics is required and economic concepts will be explained and discussed with the minimum use of jargon and mathematics.Through lecture, online discussion, and tutorial participation, students will explore both political science and economic theories with an explicit focus on the practical trade-offs that exist when resolving competing values such as fairness, equality, and maximizing human welfare.  These issues tend to be highly polarising and current trends in media and technology are reducing the ability of people to discuss and resolve these competing values.  One explicit goal of this unit is for students to develop the skills necessary to identify the competing values associated with a particular economic policy and use empirically grounded theories to find practical solutions that best intermediate those values.  These skills are incredibly valuable for society and unfortunately tend to be tragically under-developed.","enjoyResponse":35,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMU2140","eftsl":0.125}
