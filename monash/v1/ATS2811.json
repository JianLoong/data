It focuses on various elements of performance, including technical knowledge, stage-management, acting, and devising and students may choose their area of specialization. Each week students will complete short performance exercises exploring a particular element of performance. They will then proceed to make a self-initiated work drawing on the ideas and practices of the weekly sessions. In addition there will be several guided performance projects throughout the semester, led by industry practitioners. As well as practical projects, students will undertake readings, presentations, and work on portfolios to demonstrate their integration of the theories of performance into their practical research.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2811","eftsl":0.125}
