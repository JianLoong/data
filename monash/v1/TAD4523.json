Attention is given to the way in which the terms of an investigation inevitably shape the material which is discovered.  The range of topics may include techniques in information gathering and efficient management of bibliographic resources, postmodern theory, difference studies, post-structural writing and deconstruction.  The unit ponders the relationship of studio research (i.e. designing innovative objects or spaces or interfaces) to conventional research.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"TAD4523","eftsl":0.125}
