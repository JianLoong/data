The unit examines neo-classical explanation of labour supply and demand decisions and addresses how well those theories explain observed patterns in the data. In this unit we shall examine employers\u0027 incentives and behaviour that determine the labour demand curve, the interaction between wages, income, and the decision to work, the relationship between wages and undesirable job characteristics, and the incentives for and the effects of educational and training investments and contemporary issues such as labour mobility, discrimination and income inequality.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ECC3710","eftsl":0.125}
