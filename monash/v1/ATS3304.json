The unit examines and illuminates \u0027Identity\u0027 through a variety of approaches of different disciplines.  The unit will: Help students to grasp abstract and complex ideas from a range of disciplines (\u003dmultidisciplinary), and to synthesize these into thoughtful intellectual responses (\u003dinterdisciplinary), that lead students to insights that may lie beyond the scope of a single discipline (\u003dtransdisciplinary). Help students understand the symbiotic potential of traditionally distinct disciplines. Engage students fully with \u0027active\u0027 learning.  It will be faithful to the notion that participation and experiential learning foster a deeper understanding of complex material. Enhance and consolidate students\u0027 academic and research abilities, while also stimulating team-work and collaboration, thus creating a pool of transferable skills that students can acquire and practice. Make productive links between theoretical ideas and practical applications.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3304","eftsl":0.125}
