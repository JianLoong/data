The local, national and global contexts of STEM and STEM education are explored, particularly in terms of how these contexts interplay with educational settings such as schools. The unit focuses on considering how STEM contexts have an impact on your thinking as both an educator and a leader in STEM education, and explores the opportunities and challenges that this notion brings, which may require a reframing of thinking and practice. Skills such as critical analysis, synthesis of complex information, problems and concepts will be developed in practitioner research contexts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5301","eftsl":0.125}
