Solution methods for boundary layer equations for the prediction of drag, lift and boundary layer separation on airfoil surfaces follows. Flow instability and transition from laminar to turbulent flow is examined and boundary layer stability analysis is introduced. Turbulence physics and turbulent shear flows and the analysis of turbulent shear flows are covered together with an introduction to statistical analysis in turbulence and aerodynamic flow control.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE4965","eftsl":0.125}
