Drawing on a range of national and international literature, it further develops students\u0027 critical understandings of historical and current debates in media education and trends in contemporary practice and curriculum. Working collaboratively and independently, and exploring some basic research approaches, students examine different approaches to teaching and researching key media studies topics, including media industry, social values and the media, audience and media influence and media production. Students apply their knowledge of these topics to design, implement and critically reflect on sequential programs of media studies lessons and assessment programs for diverse students at a range of levels with an awareness of national and international curriculum documents.","enjoyResponse":16,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5164","eftsl":0.125}
