At a theoretical level, the unit introduces students to the concepts of social inclusion/exclusion and inclusive practice within sport and physical activity settings. This enables students to develop a sophisticated understanding of the issues associated with diversity and inclusion. In practical sessions, the unit develops students\u0027 knowledge on differentiating their delivery to meet the learning needs of diverse participants, including those from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage, and people with disabilities. Students develop understanding of how inclusive delivery of sport and physical activity can contribute to a more equitable and sustainable world. The practical sessions develop strategies to support students to deliver sport and physical activity in ways that are ethical, foster participation and are challenging for all. They encourage students to reflect on their practice, developing skills to become advocates for inclusive delivery in their future work.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3172","eftsl":0.125}
