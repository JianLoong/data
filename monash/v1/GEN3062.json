This unit will describe how the four evolutionary forces, mutation, random genetic drift, natural selection and gene flow act within and between populations to cause evolutionary change. It covers quantitative genetic, genomic and experimental approaches to understanding the genetic basis of evolutionary change.  The unit offers a combination of interactive lectures, problem based tutorials and laboratory practicals to explore theoretical concepts of evolution and their role in applied problems of the modern world.","enjoyResponse":25,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"GEN3062","eftsl":0.125}
