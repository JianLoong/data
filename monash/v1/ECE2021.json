This study includes a mathematical description of the fields, an examination of the basic laws governing the generation of fields, and a study of interactions with dielectric and magnetic materials. Maxwell\u0027s field equations are introduced. Applications of electromagnetic fields such as radio, televisions, transformers, electrical motors and generators are examined, as are electrostatic painting, magnetohydrodynamics and beam control in a synchrotron. Naturally generated fields such as the earth\u0027s magnetic field and the electric fields causing lightning are also discussed.","enjoyResponse":90,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE2021","eftsl":0.125}
