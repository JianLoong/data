The classical morphogenetic steps/stages in organ development are described, as well as the most up to date knowledge of the molecular/genetic and foetal/maternal environmental regulation of these morphogenetic processes.  Organ systems covered include musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, central nervous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal and reproductive. Students will learn how abnormalities in genetic and/or environmental regulation of development lead to birth defects as well as chronic diseases in adulthood.","enjoyResponse":57,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"DEV3022","eftsl":0.125}
