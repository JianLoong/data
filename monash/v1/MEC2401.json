Students will be taught the fundamentals of kinematics and kinetics of rigid bodies and systems of particles and to carry out dynamic analysis to balance systems with rotating and reciprocating masses. Students will also be introduced to 3-dimensional dynamics of rigid bodies. The fundamentals of mechanical vibration, analysis and synthesis of planar mechanisms and experimental modeling will complete the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC2401","eftsl":0.125}
