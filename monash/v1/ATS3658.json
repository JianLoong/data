Students learn how the principles and codes of journalism ethics influence and impact on journalism practice. Students explore debates about privacy, chequebook journalism, sensationalism, news images and ethics, conflicts of interest, plagiarism, self-regulation, gender and media stereotypes, and reporting of race and minorities. Students learn the extent of ethical constraints and freedoms and the tensions that arise among media owners, media regulators, journalists, and the public in reporting of news. The challenges of rapid technological change provide a framework within which to consider trends and dilemmas in journalism ethics in the 21st century.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3658","eftsl":0.125}
