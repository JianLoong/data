Thus, no market can exist without acknowledging international forces, trends and pressures. International trade, investment and service markets have been the fastest growing sectors of the world economy since the end of WWII. The dynamic growth of international markets and global marketing has evolved in a context of fundamental underlying forces and concepts. Electronic marketing; globalisation; standardisation; customisation; and horizontal management structures are some of those influences.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MKC3220","eftsl":0.125}
