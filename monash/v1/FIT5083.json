This unit will cover key performance concepts in copper cables, optical fibre cabled and wireless transmission media. This includes atmospheric propagation impact on QoS, satellite and wireless systems, Wifi, WiMax network propagation issues and planning concepts, and satellite and terrestrial service planning concepts. The infrastructure requirements, reliability and maintainability of networks with specific transmission media will be covered, including the application of GIS, Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks in design and planning for terrestrial, mobile and cellular systems.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5083","eftsl":0.125}
