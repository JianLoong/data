An important aspect of teaching learners with diverse needs is to understand the learner well. Students learn the practical assessment processes of gathering and interpreting information for use by learners and their teachers, to decide where the learners are in their learning progression, what impacts on progress, and what strategies can maximise their learning. The focus of this unit is on assessment for learning as well as assessment of learning. Assessment for learning involves self-reflection and self-assessment, feedback and strategies that allow teachers to make better learning and teaching decisions. The unit develops pre-service teachers\u0027 own understanding of how their learning is taking place and how it can be developed. In addition, the unit develops understanding of assessment strategies, including informal and formal, diagnostic, formative and summative approaches to assess student learning, moderation processes and the use of information and communication technologies in learning and assessment","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1552","eftsl":0.125}
