It explores trauma from international and interdisciplinary perspectives: as a concept that spans such areas as psychology, film and media studies, literature, history, philosophy, and anthropology, among others. In turn, that exploration will help illuminate a number of transnational and transhistorical case studies that may include: the rise and scope of modernity from a global perspective at the turn of the nineteenth century; war traumas associated with both past and current conflicts spanning Europe, Asia, and the Middle East; experiences of political and social struggles, human rights violations, and genocides taking place throughout the globe; issues of colonization and decolonization; the perpetration of sexual and gender-based violence worldwide; and to the study of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and other classifications of individual and collective suffering that shape how traumatic histories are remembered and represented","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3956","eftsl":0.125}
