Vector analysis with physical applications. Integration in three dimensions: along curves, over surfaces and throughout regions of space. Identities including Gauss\u0027s divergence theorem and Stokes\u0027 theorem. The continuity, momentum and energy equations for fluid flow, expressed in 3D vector form. Mass transport (diffusion and advection), diffusion across a liquid/gas interface and light availability (Lambert-Beer model). Random variables, their probability distributions and expected values as summary measures. The Poisson, normal, exponential distributions and distributions useful in the analysis of extremes. Point and interval estimation of model parameters. Simple linear regression and correlation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAT2731","eftsl":0.125}
