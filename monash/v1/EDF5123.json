The unit draws upon a constructivist theory of learning to explore the most appropriate ways of encouraging students to build their conceptual understandings of biological concepts. Linked to this, students develop and demonstrate a range of pedagogical approaches appropriate to teaching biology as evidenced in the science education research literature. Importantly, pre-service teachers are introduced to appropriate curricula (Years 7 to 12) so they are confident about aligning their teaching to the curriculum in preparation for the classroom. Throughout the unit students are encouraged to work collaboratively while being challenged to consider the key issues impacting biology education and how these might be addressed in their teaching. Students are encouraged to think critically about teaching biology, learn how to adapt their knowledge and skills within diverse contexts, and recognise the importance of reflecting upon their own practice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5123","eftsl":0.125}
