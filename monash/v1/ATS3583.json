It considers the prospects of documenting and representing the Holocaust in a period marked by a decline in the numbers of living historical witnesses and survivors, but a proliferation of film and media portraying their experiences. Central to this unit are issues pertaining to the limits and possibilities of representing the Holocaust and to the larger challenges and opportunities of utilizing works of film and media as sources of history.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3583","eftsl":0.125}
