Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of linear electronic circuit analysis and design. At the completion of the unit students will develop skills in using state of the art prototyping and measurement tools for linear electronic circuit analysis and design. The topics covered in this course include, sinusoidal steady-state analysis using phasors and complex impedances, feedback concepts, solid-state electronics, solid-state diodes and diode circuits, field-effect transistors, bipolar junction transistors and operational amplifiers.The unit will provide a grounding in circuit theory leading to solution of electrical networks with node and mesh analysis, equivalent sources, two port representations and simulation. AC analysis with phasors, first and second order transient responses will be included. Frequency and time response will be developed with Laplace transform techniques.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE2131","eftsl":0.125}
