Topics are covered in sufficient depth that students will understand the essential aerodynamic principles applied to aircraft wing design. The notable features of wing and airfoil aerodynamics are outlined, including transition and the analysis of viscous flows. Methods for the analysis and prediction of airfoil and finite wing aerodynamics are covered, together with an introduction to procedures for quantitative design.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE4409","eftsl":0.125}
