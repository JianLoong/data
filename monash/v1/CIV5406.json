The emphasis is on strategic network models which are used for longer term network planning and microsimulation models which focus on operational considerations. The traditional four step models of trip generation, mode choice and traffic assignment are considered in detail. The unit introduces the principles of simulation when applied to transport operations.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV5406","eftsl":0.125}
