The unit provides an opportunity to explore how social justice, equity and ethics influence health locally and globally. These considerations are situated within a variety of theoretical and practical contexts such as ethical and social theories, harm minimisation, citizenship, globalisation, critical media literacy and health literacy. Contemporary content covered within an Australian context includes topics such as poverty, mental health, drug use, communicable disease, conflict and climate change with a focus on sustainability and health equality. The unit seeks to challenge students to move beyond borders in order to think creatively about twenty-first century health challenges and to become compassionate, empathetic and critically responsive health professionals equipped with a global outlook on the complex factors that contribute to a sustainable future for all.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3073","eftsl":0.125}
