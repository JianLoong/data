Particular emphasis will be placed on the process of gathering information (visual research) and using image making skills to document their findings. From this, they will create a response to the unfamilar environment through a narrative of images that documents their experience. The process  is intended to assist the students to mature as artists and designers and to allow them to understand the importance of image as a means of communicating without need of verbal language.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VCO2904","eftsl":0.125}
