These driving forces and the adoption of new media and communications technologies are traced in terms of their relevance to South Africa and other African countries.  The unit uses case studies of South African and global examples of when \u0027old technologies were new\u0027 such as the telegraph and radio as well as the social shaping of very recent examples of new media, such as Online Social Networking and Twitter. Instrumentalist, substantivist and technologically determinist perspectives on new media will be compared as a means of understanding the dynamic convergence of telecommunications, IT and media industries.","enjoyResponse":22,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA2436","eftsl":0.125}
