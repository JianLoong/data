Students examine the theoretical underpinnings of digital literature in poststructuralist, cyberculture and contemporary media theories, as well as performing textual analysis of examples from major genres (hypertext fiction; networked writing; analogue-print hybrids; interactive fiction; and social-media narrative). The unit emphasises the constantly-evolving relationship between digital technologies and literary creators\u0027 uses of them. We will also consider issues of longevity and canonicity for digital literatures given the rapid rate of obsolescence in digital platforms.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3091","eftsl":0.125}
