Extensive use is made of case studies, practice exercises and practical \u0027real world\u0027 problems to reinforce the relevance of the material to contemporary professional practice. The concept of sustainable transport is introduced along with the steps in the transport planning process. Supply and demand oriented approaches to addressing transport challenges are reviewed and travel demand management is placed into context. The characteristics of transport modes and travel demand patterns are used to provide a framework for considering the suitability of a particular transport mode for a particular context. Travel survey methods are considered with an emphasis on the role of survey design and administration in the collection of useful travel survey data.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV5321","eftsl":0.125}
