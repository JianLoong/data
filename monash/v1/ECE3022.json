They will then analyse more complicated structures such as radio frequency (RF) and microwave transmission lines, rectangular metallic waveguides, optical fibers and antennas. Students will then apply these wave propagation principles to examine the practical issues of RF and microwave circuits in laboratory environments. Issues related to interference problems such as filtering, grounding and shielding in RF and microwave circuit layouts will also be covered. Finally, practical wireless communication systems will be introduced to students to give an understanding on how the theories learnt are used in real life applications.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3022","eftsl":0.125}
