Students critique and challenge ideas related to what counts as literacy and explore theoretical ideas such as critical literacy, place literacies and multiliteracies as a means to understand how one might define and describe literacy in a variety of contexts and cultures. Further, students explore theoretical ideas that help them to understand the complexities around learning new languages and learning in English when it is an additional language or dialect (EAL/D).","enjoyResponse":9,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2152","eftsl":0.125}
