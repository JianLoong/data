Subjects covered include basics ofGIS, spatial data sources, spatial data quality, spatial data analysis, terrain modelling, hydrological modelling,  habitat potential mapping, land suitability modelling, spatial analysis of landscape values and decision support systems. Case studies and hands-on practice allow students to gain experience in the use of GIS in environmental management.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ESC3259","eftsl":0.125}
