This unit examines a number of interrelated themes dealing with the development and resolution of various types of global crises.Students will be assigned specific roles and participate in an extended online and face-to-face crisis simulation.  This theoretically grounded simulation requires students to work strategically with classmates to resolve the crisis according to role-specific objectives.  Students will explore a number of factors that may prevent or accelerate the escalation of international crises, including: intervention by the international community, international agreements, the increasing concentration of media power, the emergence of social media, and transnational movements.","enjoyResponse":36,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMU3650","eftsl":0.125}
