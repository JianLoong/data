It will start with individual choice theory where the focus will be to explain the mathematical structure of the different types of objects of choice that are conceived by economists to model individual behaviour across a variety of contexts. This will be followed by an exhaustive discussion of how and when preferences over a set of objects can be represented using a real-valued utility function. The basic concepts and results in social choice theory, cooperative and non-cooperative game theory, and mechanism design will also be covered. The unit will highlight the important role of axiomatization, optimization, and strategic reasoning in microeconomics.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ECC5650","eftsl":0.125}
