It is the core unit in the discipline of thermal sciences, providing a basic level of knowledge and problem solving capability in thermodynamics and heat transfer. The thermal sciences disciplines are central to mechanical and aerospace engineering, being used in the design and analysis of energy conversion devices and systems. Inevitably, in those conversion processes involving heat, analysis and consequent design requires an understanding of the basic heat transfer mechanisms. Thus, the unit is core to understanding aircraft propulsion and computational heat and fluid flow at later year levels.","enjoyResponse":43,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE2402","eftsl":0.125}
