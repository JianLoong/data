This is followed by a comprehensive survey of cellular metabolism including: the generation of energy from major dietary components: carbohydrate, protein and lipid; the biosynthesis of carbohydrates, lipids and nucleotides; and amino acid metabolism. A study of photosynthesis illustrates the linkage between electron transport systems and biosyntheses. The integration and control of cellular biochemistry and the role of hormones in metabolic regulation is emphasised.","enjoyResponse":70,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BTH2752","eftsl":0.125}
