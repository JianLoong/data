This challenging time for parents and teachers, during which children are learning about their place within the family, their school and local community, is examined. Students are assisted to understand adolescence as the period during which children begin the transition to adulthood but are still developing maturity and their identity. Students analyse how adolescents expand their horizons and move into the adult world, and the range of challenges that can present as they move towards greater independence.","enjoyResponse":67,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4533","eftsl":0.25}
