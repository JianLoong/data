What is management? What do managers do, and how do I become a good manager? What are the effects of management practice on employees and their experience of being managed? Key contemporary issues of globalisation and cultural diversity, ethics and social responsibility affect the answers to these questions and are therefore woven throughout the curriculum. The unit draws upon a range of sources - academic, practical, popular cultural - to engage students in multiple ways of knowing about management.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGB1010","eftsl":0.125}
