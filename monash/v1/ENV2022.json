It provides hands-on and industry relevant experience in the tools and techniques for conducting a multi-disciplinary environmental assessment. Techniques for the design, implementation and analysis of environmental monitoring are examined. To increase the successful implementation of monitoring programmes in management protocols, ways to incorporate science in decision-making are explored. During this unit students will implement an environmental monitoring programme to generate reports on the state of the environment at Monash University.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENV2022","eftsl":0.125}
