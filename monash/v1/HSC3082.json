It will provide practical experience in preparation for embarking or enhancing a career in health promotion as well as opportunities to learn about career development, resume development and reflection on skills and capacities required by a graduate. Applying the knowledge gained through their course by working in agencies that undertake population-based health promotion issues will help students to better understand health determinants and behaviour in the community, and prepare them for the realities of the workplace.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"HSC3082","eftsl":0.125}
