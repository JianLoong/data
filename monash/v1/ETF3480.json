The emphasis is on recognising and identifying decision problems, modelling them and generating solutions to them. Various optimisation techniques used in the business decision-making process will be introduced. Topics include benchmarking with data envelopment analysis, game theory, queuing models, Markov chains and simulation modelling. Applications in business, particularly in management, marketing, banking and finance will be used in the demonstration.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETF3480","eftsl":0.125}
