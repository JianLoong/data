Through a multidisciplinary approach, the fundamentals of mechanical, civil and material engineering will be explained and the basic concepts of loads and motions are introduced.Team based projects will highlight the multidisciplinary nature of modern engineering. These concepts will be practised through hands-on projects carried out by teams. Communication and teamwork skills will be developed through teamwork tasks.","enjoyResponse":248,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG1001","eftsl":0.125}
