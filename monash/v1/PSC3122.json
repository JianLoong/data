Topics will include compound library design and synthesis, mapping of structure-activity relationships, lead optimization, molecular conjugates, asymmetric synthesis and processes chemistry.These will be taught as four core topic areas: This unit will build upon earlier units in synthetic organic chemistry within BPharmSci, with a special emphasis on the role of chemical synthesis in drug discovery and Chemical-Biology. This will include library design approaches for the discovery of novel bioactives and synthesis strategies in lead optimization. Students will learn about the use of conjugates in directed drug delivery and Chemical-Biology studies. They will also learn about the specific challenges posed by the scale-up and manufacture of drugs including the asymmetric synthesis of chiral drug molecules. In practical classes, students will learn new and emerging techniques for use in compound library synthesis and process chemistry. Site visits of relevant commercial operations will also be undertaken.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC3122","eftsl":0.125}
