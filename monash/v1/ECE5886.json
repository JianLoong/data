The core of the unit is intelligent infrastructure for Smart Grid and its heightening vulnerability, and how to protect it effectively.The basic economic fundamentals of power systems and conventional and renewable power generation in regulated and deregulated environment are introduced first. The basic concepts of intelligent control, application of intelligent agents in grid technology, and intelligent components commonly used in Smart Grids are extensively discussed afterward. Also included is how distribution networks adapt to intermittent energy sources (e.g. solar and wind) through the use of smart grids, emerging technologies and energy storage systems.The unit will conclude with defining concept, design and purpose of the Smart Grid, reviewing current and relevant technologies developed, assessing its vulnerabilities to a cyber-attack, and finding effective protective mechanisms for the grid.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE5886","eftsl":0.125}
