Energy supply drives our daily life, and there exist challenges in all of: clean energy, renewable energy, energy transmission, energy storage, lightweighting, and energy efficient manufacturing. All of these issues are materials engineering issues.In this unit, the fundamentals of the structure, design, and application of materials are covered. Attributes such as modulus, strength, toughness, chemical stability, electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties are be explained in terms of atomic bonding, crystal defects and polycrystalline microstructure - and how this relates to end use.A particular focus will be given to \"structure-property\" relationships, which is at the core of Materials Engineering, with the subjects concepts elaborated in the context of materials for efficient use of energy. Examples will include aerospace materials and functional materials, amongst others.","enjoyResponse":41,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG1051","eftsl":0.125}
