In particular, it focuses on the interplay between pedagogical knowledge and content knowledge theoretically conceptualised as pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). While there have been many examples of PCK as the basis for expert educator knowledge, exploring this concept in STEM education disrupts many assumptions in relation to the knowledge base of expert educators. The unit focuses on the ways in which STEM challenges the notion of knowledge as an individual attribute (belonging to a person), instead considering the knowledge as being distributed amongst people and significantly how this knowledge base is dynamic and therefore changes over time. Students are challenged to consider the ways in which a dynamic, distributed conceptualisation of knowledge can start to shift and shape our views about STEM pedagogy. Within the unit, there is a strong focus on theoretical explorations of STEM knowledge, STEM pedagogies and the development of an identity as a STEM leader together with pragmatic considerations of the ways in which these ideas shape STEM as a true interdisciplinary field which requires collaboration between educators as much as it does from students. This unit challenges STEM educators to consider the syntax and structure of STEM together with their emerging identity as a STEM leader.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5302","eftsl":0.125}
