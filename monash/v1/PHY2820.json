Students will study the endocrine system and how it coordinates and integrates to regulate health and disease. The role of hormones will be examined with respect to the male and female reproductive systems, and the gastrointestinal system. Common dysfunctions of these body systems are also explored, to allow for a greater understanding and appreciation of both the normal physiology and disease states. This unit will provide a foundation in human physiology to support further study in medical sciences.","enjoyResponse":66,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHY2820","eftsl":0.125}
