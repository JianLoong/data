This unit is designed to place this contemporary engagement within an historical, theoretical and practical perspective. It examines travel practices, attitudes and ideologies in a range of texts, including the popular travel book and the tourist guidebook, fiction, film and journalism. Its scope ranges from ancient pilgrimages through imaginary voyages, utopian fantasies, New World traveller\u0027s tales and the imperial quest, to the diverse branches of tourism today, including sex tourism and cyber travel.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2443","eftsl":0.125}
