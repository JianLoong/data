Although all students can be assumed to be experienced users of the web, very few have any clear understanding of the technologies upon which the web is based, and the way in which these technologies affect web-based applications. This unit aims to give students a sound basic knowledge of the web and a range of issues which may be involved in web application development. It will take a strongly practical focus in examining the technology, design and implementation problems a developer needs to address in developing applications for real-world systems. The diversity of web applications means that there are a wide range of issues which may be relevant to the development of any given web site. The unit will aim to give breadth of coverage of these issues, rather than focusing in depth on any particular development task or any specific type of web application.The unit will take a strongly practical focus in examining the technology issues involved, and highlight the key issues which a developer needs to address in developing applications of this kind for real-world systems.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT1050","eftsl":0.125}
