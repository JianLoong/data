By examining the geopolitical impact of hills, forests, plains and coasts, the unit also addresses the interplay of tradition and modernity; the impact of war, migration and diaspora on expressive cultures; the relationship between performance practice and musical meaning; and, the role of music in the construction of ethnic, regional and national identities. In addition, students participate in a gamelan ensemble (an Indonesian percussion orchestra) as part of the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3926","eftsl":0.125}
