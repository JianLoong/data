It will review the origins of the Genocide Convention, and discuss the evolving interpretation of the definition bearing in mind its relationship to the cognate concept of crimes against humanity. The use of the term genocide as a political rather than a legal characterization will be considered. By the end of the course, students should have a good general familiarity with the major legal texts concerning genocide and the relevant case law of international and national courts and tribunals. Specific issues to be considered will include the protected groups, the mental and physical elements, direct and public incitement to commit genocide and the phenomenon of genocide denial.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5404","eftsl":0.125}
