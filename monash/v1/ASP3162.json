The unit covers the basic equations of compressible hydrodynamics, including the behaviour of linear waves, the transition to shocks and the behaviour of fluids at high Mach number. Students will apply this to understand the physical processes that power accreting sources including white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes, and the physics behind the explosion of stars as supernovae. Students will gain practical experience in computational fluid dynamics including basic programming skills and an understanding of how large scale astrophysical simulations are performed.Students will also learn about high-energy observational techniques of supernova remnants and compact objects and statistical approaches for inference-based interpretation of high-energy observational data.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ASP3162","eftsl":0.125}
