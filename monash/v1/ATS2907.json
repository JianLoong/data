In many cases, this era saw the breakdown of the classical Islamic paradigms of political and spiritual leadership, and the consequent development of new Islamist ideologies and movements. Examples will be considered from both Sunni and Shiite perspectives, and the lives and works of significant figures in modern Islamic history will be studied in order to understand how Islamic religious thought has responded to the colonial age.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2907","eftsl":0.125}
