A range of behaviour change procedures to establish new behaviours, increase desirable behaviours and decrease undesirable behaviours are introduced. ABA typically employs single-subject research methodology. This unit introduces students to this technology, encompassing observational systems and single-subject research designs. The unit also highlights the role of functional behavioural assessment procedures in the context of positive behaviour support (PBS) and the development of effective non-aversive behaviour reduction interventions. It outlines the basic issues in developing behaviour modification programs to change one\u0027s own behaviour, a process called self-management. The ethical and social validity issues around the implementation of behaviour change procedures are highlighted, specifically in relation to those involving interventions including aversive procedures.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4603","eftsl":0.125}
