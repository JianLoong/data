The unit provides instruction in the development of a clinical research question and creating a concise protocol that includes literature review, study design, subject sampling and recruitment, instruments and other measurement approaches, sample size, consent form, budget and timetable. The aim of the unit is to introduce students to the processes and regulations involved in developing a therapeutic through to clinical trials.
