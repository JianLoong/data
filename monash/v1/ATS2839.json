A major focus is on opponents and proponents of consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, which judge the morality of an act solely in terms of its consequences. Alternative theories include other elements, such as the nature of the act itself, human rights, rationality, and the character of the actor. Another key theme of the unit is metaethics, which includes questions such as: Are there moral facts? If so, are they in some sense objective? Is moral judgement grounded primarily in reasoning or in emotion? What motivates us to do what we believe is right?","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2839","eftsl":0.125}
