Digital modulation techniques, including quadrature modulation and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) will be covered. The effects of noise on bit error rates will be covered, along with techniques to reduce them, including matched filtering and equalisation. Information theory covers questions of capacity, diversity, and error correction coding. Finally the use of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communication systems will be covered.","enjoyResponse":14,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4042","eftsl":0.125}
