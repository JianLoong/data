It begins by introducing the computing package MATLAB which is widely used in science and engineering. MATLAB will be the basis for all teaching and practical work. Topics covered include error analysis, the solution of algebraic equations; approximations of functions: curve fitting, least squares and interpolation; analysis of data by Fourier Transforms and FFTs; numerical differentiation and integration; ordinary differential equations. These topics will be supported with case studies drawn from various disciplines in the physical sciences.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MTH3051","eftsl":0.125}
