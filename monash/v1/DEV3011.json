How gene expression is regulated during development and thereby leads to the development of differentiated cells and tissues is considered. Communication between cells during development is described, as well as the key concepts of induction and competence. Some of the key early developmental processes and experimental strategies for studying developmental biology are covered. Finally, patterning and development of the body plan are described.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"DEV3011","eftsl":0.125}
