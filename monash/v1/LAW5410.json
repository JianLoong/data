If the dispute is not resolved and proceeds to litigation, the lawyers who are engaged in the collaborative process must withdraw. Collaborative law has been practised overseas for many years and has been used in Australia since 2006.This unit has a practical focus and includes a series of interactive simulation exercises which encourage students to integrate their skills and to become aware of their own personal style as well as the values, attitudes and cultural influences that they bring to the resolution of conflicts. It also encourages students to consider other styles they can access, as appropriate. It assumes some basic understanding of negotiation processes and skills but does not assume any prior legal training or legal knowledge.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5410","eftsl":0.125}
