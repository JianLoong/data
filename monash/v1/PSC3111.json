It will address the interactions between endogenous ligands and drugs with their receptors, enzymes or nucleic acids, and the way that drugs mimic, oppose or modify those interactions. Students will be introduced to the scope of medicinal chemistry techniques used in contemporary drug discovery.This will involve the study of: G-protein coupled receptors other receptor types ion channels nuclear hormone receptors drugs interacting with oligonucleotides enzymes and enzyme inhibition","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC3111","eftsl":0.125}
