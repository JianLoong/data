They look beyond everyday explanations for realities of life and culture, and use their perceptions to create better futures for humans and their collectives. Students will explore case studies in: globalisation, mobility, poverty, development, environmental change, resistance, indigeneity, technology and online worlds, gender and sexuality, sex and reproduction, magic, spirituality and religion.
