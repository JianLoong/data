In particular, we focus on the skills involved in argument analysis. We will address the essential features of good arguments and how they can be articulated and represented. We will also examine the many ways in which reasoning can go wrong and how to avoid them. While we will focus on some of the theory of successful thinking, our main focus will be the practical techniques necessary for you to reason more effectively. Students completing the unit successfully will be better at evaluating evidence, critiquing arguments, and will be able to use these abilities in a wide variety of future studies.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2946","eftsl":0.125}
