Students apply the principles of individual occupational challenges to case based scenarios in which advanced clinical reasoning and intervention skills are required for people experiencing complex health and social problems. The cases chosen highlight the multiple approaches to occupational intervention, both individual/clinical and community/prevention.","enjoyResponse":38,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"OCC3052","eftsl":0.25}
