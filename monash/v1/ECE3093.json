Numerical methods for working efficiently with large matrices and handling ill-conditioned data will be discussed. Methods for unconstrained and constrained optimisation will be presented, with use of MATLAB. The second half of the unit will focus on stochastic processes in both discrete and continuous time, with applications to time series modelling, and circuit analysis.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3093","eftsl":0.125}
