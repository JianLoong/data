Topographic studies will cover the morphology and organisation of the musculoskeletal system, the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the digestive system, urinary system, endocrine system, nervous system and reproductive system. Histology studies will correlate microscopic structure with function; beginning with the cell, moving on to the four primary tissue types and following up with systems-based histology where relevant. Embryology will help in understanding human development; beginning with fertilization and following up through the development of organ-body systems, with emphasis on mechanisms regulating normal development and organisation of the body. The unit encompasses familiarisation and usage of anatomical and medical terminology. Skills in practical observation, identification and communication will be encouraged as well as the ability to source for information through effective use of IT.","enjoyResponse":68,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ANT1800","eftsl":0.125}
