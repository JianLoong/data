Students investigate key priorities in primary and secondary education connected to the Australian and Victorian curricula and in relation to the professional standards of the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL). The unit explores the cross-curriculum priorities of Asia and Australia\u0027s engagement with Asia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, histories and cultures, and education for sustainability, as well as relevant general capabilities. This investigation is contextualised within a broad whole-school as well as specific HPE context. Students draw upon interdisciplinary knowledge developed in first year to explore exemplars of policies and practice as they continue to build knowledge of varied approaches to HPE in the school and community. Students examine the general capabilities including literacy, numeracy and ICT with a focus on those relevant to HPE in Victorian schools and the way they inform teaching and learning in schools. Through combining theory and practice across discipline areas, students continue to enhance their understanding of the wider educational settings, cross-curricular priorities, general capabilities and other programming and planning priorities in HPE.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2071","eftsl":0.125}
