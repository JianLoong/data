It endeavours to expose them to a range of illustration styles and techniques, while promoting a broad use of them in traditional and experimental forums. While studying existing illustration styles, students will be encouraged towards an individual image making process that they can develop in future projects, both within this unit and others. The role of Illustration as a vital component to contemporary visual communication will be heavily emphasised.","enjoyResponse":26,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VCO1203","eftsl":0.125}
