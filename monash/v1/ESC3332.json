The unit will provide an understanding of the subtle interplay between Earth structure, planetary cooling, geomagnetism, mantle convection, plate tectonics, continental drift, heat flow, earthquakes, melt generation etc, and the diverse measurements/ models needed to gain this understanding including seismicity, seismic tomography, gravity, changing sea level, post-glacial rebound etc. It will concentrate on an integrated, quantitative, model-based approach to the geosciences.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ESC3332","eftsl":0.125}
