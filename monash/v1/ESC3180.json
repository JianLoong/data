The emphasis will be on observing, recording, and interpreting geologic phenomena in the field. Students will draw on a theoretical background of lectures and laboratory studies in first, second and third-year geology to analyse real rocks in the real world. Students will use their observations and interpretations to construct geological maps and cross-sections and determine the geological history of a complex poly-deformed terrane.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ESC3180","eftsl":0.125}
