It enables students to teach psychology and lay a strong foundation for career-long professional learning. Students become familiarised with psychology curricula and national and international research literature, including current developments and historical views. Students explore the complexities of teaching to enhance student learning of psychology and use these understandings to design and implement purposeful learning activities within a range of contexts. This unit encourages students to consider the purpose of teaching psychology in schools. Students develop an understanding of the subject discipline\u0027s place within secondary schools, at senior level (Years 11 and 12) and junior level (Years 7 to 10), including within the science domain, and its links to other domains such as health and humanities. The unit emphasises a view of learning about teaching as an ongoing, collaborative process that is developed through engaging with theory, research and critical reflection on experience.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5175","eftsl":0.125}
