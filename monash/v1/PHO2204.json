Students will be introduced to advanced video cameras, studio lighting techniques, editing software and various approaches to output including screen-based, projection and installation. While this unit provides a practical grounding in video production tools and materials there is an emphasis on the creative and experimental potential of these tools and how they are utilised within a broader creative practice. Students are encouraged to develop their own creative direction alongside a critical awareness of their ideas.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"PHO2204","eftsl":0.125}
