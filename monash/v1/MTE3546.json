The mechanical and thermal properties of ceramics, the structure and production of amorphous ceramics and porous ceramics, the glass transition, optical and electrical properties of glass. The mechanical properties of polymers are very dependent on the timescale and temperature and so the structural basis of linear viscoelasticity and time/temperature superposition are discussed. The mechanical properties of elastomers, crosslinking and reinforcement, rubber elasticity and the tear and fatigue of elastomers. The Eyring theory and methods of toughening polymers are discussed.","enjoyResponse":32,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE3546","eftsl":0.125}
