It develops students\u0027 knowledge and understanding of Indigenous cultures with a particular focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The unit considers Indigenous and other forms of education alongside the provision of mainstream schooling by nation states. Students develop their understanding of the impact of culture, cultural identity and linguistic background on the education of students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds. They explore and utilise education programs which have successfully engaged with learners from Indigenous and traditionally oriented societies and achieved improvements in their education outcomes. Students also develop broad knowledge, understanding and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their histories, cultures and languages, to meet expectations in the Australian Curriculum and the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. They develop skills and insights into how to engage learners from Indigenous and traditional communities and create successful partnerships that improve academic outcomes and foster reconciliation.","enjoyResponse":88,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2031","eftsl":0.125}
