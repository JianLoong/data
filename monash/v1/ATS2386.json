Sustainability and Australia","description":"How has the landscape shaped the definition of what it means to be Australian? How has Australia responded to the global challenge of creating a sustainable society? Have non-indigenous Australians learned from Aboriginal relationships with the natural environment, and what challenges do we now face in living with the land? This unit considers the climatic, cultural and economic forces which have shaped the landscape, exploring the dynamic interaction between Australians and their environment. It draws on a range of disciplines, including history, tourism, literature, geography, politics, journalism and cultural studies. It includes intensive field trips/excursions to the historic Rocks area of Sydney, indigenous sites and wilderness areas.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2386","eftsl":0.25}
