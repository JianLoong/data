It reinforces architectural design as a process of investigation, critical observation, and experiment. Students will demonstrate mastery of design research as a synthetic process encompassing a range of complex issues inherent in the production of architecture: form, material, structure, program, site, history and representation architectural form. Studies in the unit will maintain a focus on developing design as a visual language and process of cultural production with an emphasis on social and environmental sustainability.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"ARC5002","eftsl":0.375}
