The focus will be archaeological sites and debates associated with the interpretation of excavated cultural materials. Issues covered include the origins of the first Australians, processes of continental colonisation, responses to environmental change and sea level change, human environmental impacts, broad-scale social changes; and responses to Europeans on the colonial frontier. Students will also examine long-term changes in the development of trading networks, art, social organisation and burial practices.","enjoyResponse":14,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3543","eftsl":0.125}
