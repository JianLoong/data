With a focus on a range of bold and current material from world film and screen contexts, students will study new forms of narrativisation, exhibition, aesthetics, authorship, spectatorship, genre and performance, attending to how these practices extend, revise and subvert classical traditions. Particular attention will be paid to how these new practices demonstrate the ideological capacity of film and screen texts to shape identity politics around issues of gender, race and sexuality. Students will also be introduced to new theories and concepts in film and screen scholarship, such as those from the areas of intermediality, film-philosophy and neurocinematics. Across the study of both texts and theories, consideration will be given to how contemporary issues of hybridity, convergence and digital culture have shaped these new directions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2962","eftsl":0.125}
