Performance in Context II will extend students\u0027 understanding of concepts, theories and practices in the discipline. Whereas as Performance in Context I exposes students to traditions and conventions of mainstream theatre, Performance in Context II will explore challenges to convention, such as avant-garde theatre, feminist performance art, and site-specific performance. Students will create their own devised work as part of the assessment requirements.","enjoyResponse":50,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1288","eftsl":0.125}
