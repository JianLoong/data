Working from clay and wax originals glass is cast into hand built refractory moulds, fired in a kiln and then polished.  These processes allow the transference of original and found objects to be re-contextualised into glass.  Students will explore the unique optical and material properties of the medium and will acquire an understanding to contemporary approaches. Projects are conceptually based and can incorporate a multi-media approach.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"GLS2213","eftsl":0.125}
