The unit takes a broad view of learning and learners and introduces students to various perspectives including psychological, sociological and philosophical. Students identify and analyse their own and others\u0027 learning processes in the light of current research developments pertaining to these varying perspectives. The implications these hold for practitioners who develop learners and professional learning across learning contexts in families, schools, workplaces and communities is identified and linked to ideas and concepts central to educative processes and practices.
