The topics to be covered include i) the specification and estimation of systems of consumer demand equations and producer demand and supply equations and extensions of these methods to other areas; and ii) structural vector autoregressions and error correction models, together with some practical applications that address macroeconomic issues. On completion of this unit students should be familiar with recent developments in these fields and have developed the skills to undertake empirical work. Further, students should be able to critically evaluate empirical work and related policy implications.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETC4410","eftsl":0.125}
