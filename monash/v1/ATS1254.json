This unit will explore these aspects through focussing on the ongoing relationship between Indigenous and Settler Australians.  This unit explores points of contestation and how this has shaped the position of Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australians in contemporary society.  Key periods in Indigenous Australia are discussed and the way in which Anthropology has been involved in the process of understanding Indigenous relationships to each other and to the land.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1254","eftsl":0.125}
