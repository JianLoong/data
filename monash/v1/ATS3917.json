This access and understanding has been correspondingly shaped by developments in censorship and propaganda that have resulted in an array of responsive artistic reactions in literature, film, photography and the visual arts. This unit will examine how the advent of new communications technology - the mass circulation newspaper, the telegraph, photography, the newsreel, radio, television, cable television, the internet and the mobile telephone - has re-framed the public\u0027s perceptions war and how this has been reflected in an array of literary, cinematic, photographic and other artistic responses. Through an analysis of wars from the Crimea to Afghanistan the unit will examine how communications technology, censorship, literary and other artistic responses have influenced and fed off one another to shape the representation and perception of conflict.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3917","eftsl":0.125}
