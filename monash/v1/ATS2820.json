Many shun help because of the attendant stigma, and suffering is then often prolonged. This unit seeks to decrease stigma through knowledge. A wide range of disorders are examined, along with their causes and treatment options according to various paradigms. The complexities of defining the concept of \"abnormal\" will be discussed, along with the DSM and alternative methods of describing and classifying and diagnosing mental illness.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2820","eftsl":0.125}
