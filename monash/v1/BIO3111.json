The unit will focus on teaching core skills in applied ecology that should inform any management process. There is less emphasis on policy and legislative issues, except where they directly affect management decisions. The unit will focus on a range of issues that are of current importance in both academic research areas and also in important new policy developments in Victoria and in Australia generally. The practical component will consist of three projects that directly relate to the three lecture units within the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO3111","eftsl":0.125}
