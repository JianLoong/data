The unit has a 10 week academic block followed by a 3 week fieldwork (clinical) block to apply theory into practice. Students are introduced to the mechanisms and consequences of problems related to mental, sensory, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological and biomechanical capacities of humans, across the lifespan, that underpin occupational engagement and occupational performance. Students will integrate this knowledge into occupational therapy and related theories and models of practice. Students will be required to develop clinical questions, and acquire knowledge and skills from the process of describing and evaluating occupational performance, and critiquing assessment tools for evaluating occupational engagement and occupational performance. Students will explore different contexts in which participation in occupation takes place.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"OCC2011","eftsl":0.5}
