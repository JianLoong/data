Continuing the emphasis on perceptive synthesis of the range of complex issues inherent in the production of architecture: material, structure, program, site, history and representation will be investigated in their relationship to the production of architectural form.Design Studio 3 continues to emphasise the development of architectural designs through the three-dimensional and material testing of ideas. Students will continue the development of two and three-dimensional modes of representation. Studies will focus on developing an increasingly sophisticated understanding of design as a visual language and process of cultural production with a focus on social and environmental sustainability.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"ARC2001","eftsl":0.25}
