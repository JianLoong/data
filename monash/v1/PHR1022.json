To address these key areas, students will study the fundamentals of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology, with an emphasis on structure-activity relationships, drug-target interactions and the mechanism of action of medicines. Students will explore the concepts of drug clearance and volume of distribution, and how these impact on the secondary pharmacokinetic parameters which ultimately lead to the design of safe and effective therapeutic dosage regimens.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PHR1022","eftsl":0.375}
