The unit will consider such themes as how spaces and places have been contested across time, encoded with social, cultural and political meaning, become historically significant,  and generate and reflect historical change and continuity. The unit will introduce students to specific historiographies of a range of historical periods (which may include the medieval, Renaissance, modern and contemporary worlds) and students will examine the range of interpretive frameworks for reading space and place. The unit examines such concepts as territory, borders and frontiers, sacred space, urban space, public and private space. The unit thus aims to introduce honours students both to the \u0027spatial turn\u0027 in history, and to the ways that place and space are historically significant.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4217","eftsl":0.25}
