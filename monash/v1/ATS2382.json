It considers such well-known events as the Nanking Massacre of 1937 and the sexual slavery of so-called \u0027comfort women , as well as lesser known issues such as the use of Asian forced labour on the Burma-Thailand Railway or the experiences of colonial soldiers (Korean, Taiwanese, Filipino, Indian) in the conflict. Importantly, the unit examines critically how debates about the past affect international and domestic relations in the region, and why the wartime past continues to haunt Japan and its neighbours to this day.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2382","eftsl":0.125}
