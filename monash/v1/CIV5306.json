An appreciation of the design of traffic elements on the road network and a rigorous detective approach to investigating road crash data will be developed. Participants will learn applied skills to find road crash data and analyse it to determine the nature and extent of road crash problems at any given site. An ability to translate road crash data into meaningful information, determine counter measure options from thorough analysis of information and prioritise and evaluate counter measure implementation programs will be cultivated.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV5306","eftsl":0.125}
