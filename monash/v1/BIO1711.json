The emphasis is on the study of discrete cell populations and organs within each system and the integration of these systems to meet the needs of the functioning organism. The relationship between structure and function is an underlying theme of the course. Laboratory and tutorial classes are divided into two streams: the human/ medical stream or the animal/ veterinary stream; students select the stream appropriate to their study program and interests.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO1711","eftsl":0.125}
