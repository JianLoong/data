By analysing performers, audiences, texts and technologies, the unit also investigates specific musical practices in order to generate broader questions about music. How do musicians learn? What does music tell us about culture? What is the musical event? These are some of the questions that will be examined in the unit. The unit is open to all students with an interest in music. No prior musical experience required.","enjoyResponse":60,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1346","eftsl":0.125}
