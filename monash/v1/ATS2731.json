Studying issues such as population growth, resource and service allocation, climate change and sustainability and the impact of globalisation upon regional communities provides a platform for a more distinct understanding of rural life and the sociological theories that frame them. In particular this unit focuses on exploring the manner in which people in regional/rural areas conduct their lives in the face of diverse environmental, cultural, political and social change. We engage with the research and debates that surround these issues and focus each week on various case studies that provide in-depth illustration of the impact these have for communities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2731","eftsl":0.125}
