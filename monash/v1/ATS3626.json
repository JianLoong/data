Case studies include environmental and industrial disasters, pandemics, famines, and climate change events. We examine the processes that make disasters \u0027global\u0027, like travel and communications technologies and environmental systems. Using films, photographs, media reports and autobiographical sources, we examine the representation and experience of disasters to learn how they have been understood, experienced and responded to in contested ways. In doing so, we analyse the social causes of \u0027natural\u0027 and \u0027unnatural\u0027 disasters; how catastrophes have been catalysts for social change; and how disasters stimulate utopian and dystopian ideas about the globe\u0027s future.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3626","eftsl":0.125}
