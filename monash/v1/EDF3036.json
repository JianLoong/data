They build their capacity to capture, articulate and demonstrate their developing practice in a professional portfolio of evidence of their learning across the dimensions of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. This includes the three domains of teaching: professional knowledge, professional practice and professional engagement. Drawing on their learning in university coursework and through professional experience in varied education settings, students explore what it means to be engaged in the education profession through consideration of the nature of teachers\u0027 and educators\u0027 work and of leadership in education. They explore policy and practice involved in the ethical, professional, industrial, legal, emotional, intellectual and physical dimensions of the work of teachers and educators in multiple contexts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3036","eftsl":0.125}
