Their application, principles of operation, accuracy, advantages, limitations, ground systems and the flight vehicle requirements of avionics equipment. Navigation systems with an emphasis on typical forms of measurements involved, their use to pilots and industry are covered. Steering systems, self contained and radio direction finding systems and components, system interfacing, instrumentation and control are examined. Issues of interference, compatibility, redundancy and operational safety and a brief look at active navigation aids complete the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE4407","eftsl":0.125}
