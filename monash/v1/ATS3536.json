The unit takes a range of case studies to understand how film and television texts set themselves apart dominant forms and practices at certain historical moments and in diverse national contexts. For example the unit might examine the new American cinema of the sixties and European counter-cinema of the seventies, or post-punk and American indie films of the 1980s and beyond. In the same way, the unit may take as its case study the work of women or Indigenous, or political filmmakers worldwide.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3536","eftsl":0.125}
