It provides an overview of how these fields have formed, how they have cross-fertilised each other and where they now stand within the contemporary academy. Topics that may be addressed include: the relation of the fields to social and political movements beyond the academy; their intersection with fields of practice (from media production to professional communication); their institutional locations; their ambivalent interdisciplinarity; their international influences and distribution; their varying formation through teaching and research; and their loosely shared stock of key concepts and themes (for example, \u0027medium\u0027, \u0027audience\u0027, \u0027discourse\u0027, \u0027culture\u0027, \u0027genre\u0027 and \u0027power\u0027). The aim across all topics will be to reflect on the history and current possibilities of the fields, providing a basis for research students to develop an informed and critical perspective on where their own projects sit within larger intellectual and disciplinary contexts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APR6100","eftsl":0}
