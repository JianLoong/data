The role of biotechnology including enzymatic reactions, fermentation, selectivity will also be studied together with common separation liquid and liquid-solid separation processes.Global concepts relevant to biorefineries will be emphasised including the carbon cycle (micro and macro perspectives), overall sustainability of water, energy, and minimising by-products from biorefineries.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE5882","eftsl":0.125}
