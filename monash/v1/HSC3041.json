Topics include principles of infection, outbreaks, public health control measures, and current issues in disease prevention and control. Public health control measures discussed may include surveillance, modelling, immunisation, antimicrobial therapies, infection control, vector control, screening and risk factor management.These topics are illustrated using relevant examples of communicable diseases such as vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g. influenza); vector-borne diseases (e.g. malaria), food-borne diseases (e.g. salmonella) and sexually transmitted infections (e.g. HIV) and are compared with strategies to prevent and control non-communicable diseases. Epidemiological, social, and political perspectives are considered.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"HSC3041","eftsl":0.125}
