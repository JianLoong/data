In this unit, we explore the typical features of these and other genres and the ways in which language can be used to manipulate, persuade or empower the hearer/ reader. The unit introduces students to a variety of approaches to doing discourse analysis, including Conversation Analysis, Critical Discourse Analysis and Corpus Linguistics. Students apply these methods to a range of texts and reflect on the appropriateness of each for answering different types of research questions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5704","eftsl":0.25}
