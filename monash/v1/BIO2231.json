We examine a range of representatives from different animal phyla, starting with the structurally simple and progressing to mammals, in the context of emerging and changing patterns in their body plans. These are related to changes in the ecology and diversification within the phyla. Concepts and theories developed during the theory part of the course are developed further in the practical classes. During these interactive sessions use of live material is made for observation and the characters used to group animals into higher taxonomic groups are demonstrated and discussed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO2231","eftsl":0.125}
