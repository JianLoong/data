Continued research and investigation of materials and processes fosters the acquisition of technical language, and influences appropriate choices to realise concepts within the context of a developing personal visual language. The emphasis is more on self-motivated approaches than on set projects. Teaching methods therefore tend to concentrate on individual tuition and group critique.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"SCU2623","eftsl":0.125}
