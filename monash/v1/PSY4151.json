The history and the philosophy of the different schools of social psychology and personality are examined to highlight changes in our understanding of social identity, meaning and relationships. The first half of the unit will demonstrate how social psychology theories, such as behaviour in groups, aggression, attraction, dehumanisation and attitude change, are applied and critiqued in light of contemporary behaviour and new knowledge. In the second half of the unit, several different personality theories will be compared and contrasted including psychoanalytic, phenomenological, trait, and social learning approaches to personality.","enjoyResponse":42,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY4151","eftsl":0.125}
