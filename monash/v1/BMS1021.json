Basic developmental biology concepts associated with the patterning of the body plan and embryological origins of cells and tissues are introduced.The unit also introduces students to the microbial world and explores the structure and function of the immune system and how the body develops an immune response.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BMS1021","eftsl":0.125}
