Students will use knowledge from linear and non-linear electronics, computer engineering and communications engineering, to tackle a group project, applying project management skills, and extending their experience of working in groups. The project will extend the design processes introduced in the earlier units to a larger, more complex, and less constrained situation. The project will be complemented by lectures in project management, including working with teams, project management tools and techniques, and written and verbal communication. Frameworks for analysing the life cycles of systems are introduced. Tools and techniques to aid decision-making are provided.","enjoyResponse":77,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3091","eftsl":0.125}
