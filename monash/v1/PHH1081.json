Examples will be used to illustrate the importance of inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary systems thinking for the success of public health programs and policy. You will learn to critically analyse the determinants and burdens of disparate rates of illness and disease from the perspectives of health inequalities and vulnerable populations to understand public health priorities, and the core roles and functions of public health systems and programs. The learnings from this unit can be applied to public health issues and systems in any country.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PHH1081","eftsl":0.125}
