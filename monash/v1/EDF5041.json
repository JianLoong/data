Students focus on the secondary student at this stage in their life and learning trajectory. They examine salient aspects of adolescent development in the context of teacher education, as well as factors impacting on learning and wellbeing. Pre-service teachers engage in ethnographic approaches to explore adolescent cultural worlds and draw on significant features of such worlds to examine different forms of engaging curriculum. Students apply their understanding and design relevant and engaging curriculum for middle years learning.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5041","eftsl":0.125}
