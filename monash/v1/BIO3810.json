It focuses on South East Asia, (the Malaysian region in particular) but will also encompass aquatic environments in other parts of the tropics. The ecology and diversity of communities in coral reefs, oceans, sandy and rocky shores, estuaries, lakes, rivers and swamps is examined. The students will gain an understanding of the physical and chemical factors that affect these environments. Conservation and management issues such as the impacts of tourism, pollution, fisheries, wetland drainage and river regulation are studied.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO3810","eftsl":0.125}
