Through readings, discussion, simulation exercises and outside research, students will critically examine the roles of:  lawyers and other advocates negotiating on behalf of principals;  mediators and neutral third parties facilitating the negotiation process;  arbitrators, judges and clerics tasked with adjudicating disputes; and  tribal councils and international tribunals involved in managing conflict.  Classes will be designed to give students the theoretical framework to understand and evaluate dispute resolution processes in various contexts, as well as the skills to participate in the processes effectively.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4664","eftsl":0.125}
