This exercise is particularly significant to a Victorian context, given that the Victorian Charter has borrowed heavily from legal techniques developed in overseas jurisdictions for securing fundamental rights protection. The course therefore provides not only invaluable experience in the comparative method in the context of human rights law, but also important insight into the genesis of core principles of the Victorian Charter.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5373","eftsl":0.125}
