The immune system is also responsible for many common conditions such as allergy and autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. IMM2011: Basic immunology: The body\u0027s defence system, introduces students to the fundamental concepts of the immune system. It describes the structure of the immune system and how it can develop specificity and diversity for combating microbes and pathogens. Key concepts surrounding the function of the immune system in how it communicates and makes decisions when generating specific immune responses will be learnt. IMM2011 is designed to give students a basic but fundamental knowledge of the immune system useful to many areas of biomedical science. It can lead into further studies in second semester (IMM2022) and more advanced studies at level three and beyond. Together with formal lectures and tutorials, practical classes reinforce key concepts that students have been introduced. In addition, flexible learning options including on-line material, audio-taped lectures, quizzes and interactive tutorials provide students with a wide variety of experiences and skill development.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"IMM2011","eftsl":0.125}
