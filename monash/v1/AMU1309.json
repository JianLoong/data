In this unit, key areas of inquiry within Sexuality Studies are wide-ranging and include: sexual cultures, sexual communities, sexual labour or commerce or tourism, sexual education, sexual regulation or bias, sexual politics, sexual citizenship, sexual activism and rights, sexual deviance, sexual disability, sexual health and sexual ethics. The topics in this unit are highly sensitive even controversial as they set out to challenge assumptions, biases even prejudices that students have in making visible how constructed rather than naturalised gendered and sexual identities are, beginning with one\u0027s own.The unit therefore aims to enable students to realise how relevant, contemporary and intersectional the study of sexualities is across disciplines, social-cultural contexts and their own lived realities. The unit also aims to impress upon students how integral gendered and queer perspectives in sexuality matters are to understanding and transforming human relations and micro-macro structures towards realising a more sustainable, just and equitable existence for all.","enjoyResponse":97,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMU1309","eftsl":0.125}
