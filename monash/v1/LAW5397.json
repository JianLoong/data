An economic focus, including mainstream and behavioural economic considerations, will underpin the approach taken in the unit. A framework for consumer policy will be developed, including examination of rationales for market intervention and the instruments for intervention. Consideration will be given to notions of consumer detriment and its measurement, since this is an important consideration in market intervention. The links between consumer policy and competition policy will be explored. The unit will also consider approaches to market monitoring and the development of integrated compliance strategies. Institutional arrangements can have a significant impact on the operation of consumer policy and these will also be examined. Concepts considered in the early part of the unit will be applied in a number of areas subject to recent regulatory change.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5397","eftsl":0.125}
