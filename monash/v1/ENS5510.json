Critical appreciation is needed of processes and mechanisms that affect and guide such change.The unit breaks down the complexity of change processes, examining the various components of societal change (rules, norms, values, knowledge), and the different dimensions of our social world (institutional, political, organisational, community), that either help or hinder sustainable development. The unit also explores a range of formal and informal processes of influence.Blending theoretical and practical insights, the unit will equip students with a suite of tools and mechanisms for influencing, supporting and facilitating change towards sustainable development at a variety of scales, drawing on science-policy partnerships, strategic planning, social and organisational learning and advocacy networks.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENS5510","eftsl":0.125}
