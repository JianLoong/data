It involves the studying groups and/or individuals as they go about their daily lives. A central premise of this unit is that the ethnographer enters the field with an open mind, but not an empty head. Before engaging with their subjects, the ethnographer begins with a problem, a theory or model, a research design, specific data collection techniques, tools of analysis, and often specific writing style. The unit examines in detail each of these activities and traces their implications for research and the researcher.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2597","eftsl":0.125}
