Students will be encouraged to think critically about how the criminal law and its practice have evolved historically.  Violence and gender will be a focus, including an examination of violent behaviours, the censures of violent behaviours, the operation of criminal defences, and developments in the laws dealing with sexual assault. A range of current issues will be discussed, including issues raised by sentencing and imprisonment.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4111","eftsl":0.125}
