In this unit, students will travel to the heart of the world\u0027s media industry to observe how industrial crisis and creative responses are transforming news organisations, journalists and audiences in the American context. The program begins online in November, when students will delve into the history, structure, culture and products of leading and cutting-edge US and international media outlets. To follow, students attend an intensive workshop at Monash University (Caulfield) to develop skills in research design, methods, analysis and project management. Students will travel to New York to learn first hand how newsrooms are adapting to change. How have outlets responded to the pressures of changing consumption patterns, delivery platforms and business models? What is it like to be a media practitioner in the contemporary era? How are news values shifting to capture contemporary audiences? And are the foundations of journalism in a liberal democracy - notions of independence, objectivity and fairness - changing too? Students will draw from scholarly and popular literature as well their immersive experience to formulate individual research projects, adopting a case-study approach to their chosen topic.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5653","eftsl":0.25}
