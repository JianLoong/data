The anatomical representation and relationships of the bones, organs, blood vessels, nerves and muscles comprising the cranium, chest, abdomen, male and female pelvis, spine, limbs and girdles in multiple planes will be demonstrated through computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance images (MRI) and digital subtraction angiographic (DSA) imaging. Organization, structure and physiology of nervous tissue, the spinal cord and its nerves and the senses will provide students with a more in-depth understanding of the common disorders affecting the central nervous system including developmental malformations, neoplasia, demyelinating and degenerative disease processes, infective processes, cerebrovascular disease and traumatic brain injury. The unit is particularly designed to prepare students for their CT studies in year three of the course.","enjoyResponse":39,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD2092","eftsl":0.125}
