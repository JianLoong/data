These include: How do we make our cities more habitable and sustainable? How do we ensure social, economic, cultural, political and environmental equality?  How does the geography of cities and urban systems affect their sustainability? Have cities ever been sustainable and can they be in the future? How do we manage urban growth or decline? In this unit students will examine how contemporary cities operate by focussing on urban processes and functions, as well as relevant issues such as population, the economy, governance, resource use, housing and transport.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2547","eftsl":0.125}
