How can we explain and respond to the governance challenges posed by irregular labour migration and spontaneous flows of refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people? What is the relationship between security, development and different kinds of population movements? This unit provides students with an overview of global governance in relation to migration, focusing on the migration-development nexus and humanitarian responses to forced migration. Students will undertake a thorough critique of the theory and practice of governance across these areas. Through a range of learning activities, students will examine competing frameworks for governance and alternative possibilities for analysis and action in the work of development and governance agencies associated with migration and border control.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5065","eftsl":0.25}
