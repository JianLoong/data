It covers data types; data structures; algorithms; algorithmic complexity; and recursion. Detailed topics include analysis of best and worst-case time complexity; data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, graphs and heaps; hashing; sorting algorithms; searching algorithms; and graph algorithms. Students will implement these algorithms and data structures in the Python programming language.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT9059","eftsl":0.125}
