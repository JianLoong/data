The role of vegetation in interceptingand redirecting water at surface. The processes of infiltration, percolation, groundwater flow, storm flow and base flow production. Instances of major hydrological change, case studies of large-scale deforestation or desertification, habitat or biodiversity decline, including human use of water and landscape. Observation and measuring techniques employed in hydrologic research are introduced in practical class.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ESC3545","eftsl":0.125}
