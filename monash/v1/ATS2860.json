In doing so, it furthermore introduces the continental approach to philosophy. Taking our lead from Nietzsche\u0027s provocative claim that \u0027God is dead\u0027, we will look primarily at French and German philosophers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Examples of figures who may be studied include Soren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Immanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2860","eftsl":0.125}
