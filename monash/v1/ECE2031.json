AC analysis with phasors, real and reactive power, first and second order transient responses will be included.  Frequency and time response will be developed with Laplace transform techniques.Feedback control systems are introduced using differential equations, Laplace transform, time, frequency and state space representations.  the concepts of poles and zeros, forward transfer functions, and PID control will be developed.  Stability of feedback systems, root locus diagrams, Nyquist and Bode techniques, gain/phase margin concepts, and disturbance rejection will be covered.","enjoyResponse":82,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE2031","eftsl":0.125}
