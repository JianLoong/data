Topics: origin of life, metazoan origins in late Precambrian, Cambrian \u0027explosion\u0027 of shelled organisms, rapid evolution and mass extinctions (acritarchs, dinosaurs), biologic effect extraterrestrial impacts, volcanism, changing climate and geography (impact of developing aridity on biota, \u0027Snowball Earth\u0027 metazoan origins), origin of major animal groups (molluscs, marsupials). Emphasis on strengths/weaknesses of interpretive methods and how complex science can be presented to a wide audience. A field trip to a world-class fossil site will hone a wide range of field skills relevant to interpreting the record of ancient life.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ESC3232","eftsl":0.125}
