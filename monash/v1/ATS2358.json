The subsequent imposition of European law over Indigenous law created significant tensions especially in relation to Indigenous connections to land, sea and culture. This unit undertakes an interdisciplinary study related to Indigenous Law, land rights, Native Title, Indigenous knowledge and cultural heritage. The unit critically examines some of the emerging and recent debates involving: Native Title and mining; intangible heritage (art-song-story); and general public responses to Indigenous land rights.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2358","eftsl":0.125}
