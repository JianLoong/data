The project will involve a critical assessment of the design problem from engineering as well as non-engineering perspectives. The project work rely on using creative problem solving and decision-making skills and modern project management tools for developing practical solutions to the design problem. The outcomes of the project will be communicated via presentations, demonstrations and reports. This project may be undertaken either within the faculty or with external partners. This is the second part of a two-unit project sequence.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG5004","eftsl":0.125}
