It explores the negotiation of perpetrator, victim and bystander identities after genocide through histories of return and diaspora; and considers the local initiatives that rebuild post-conflict societies, including strategies of genocide prevention. It recognizes the different experiences of women, children and men in conflict and their different paths to reconciliation.
