But while this consensus exists there is substantial disagreement as regards what constitutes the optimal mix of markets and regulation. In this subject we introduce students to both the system of regulatory capitalism that prevails in the OECD and to the regulatory socialist form of governance that is being created in China. In so doing we explain why the concurrent existence of these two systems of governance have become a source of global tension.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGF5710","eftsl":0.125}
