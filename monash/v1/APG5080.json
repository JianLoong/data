This course examines the significant impact that bodily characteristics such as gender, race, age and ability have in bioethics and healthcare. It begins with philosophical exploration of ways of understanding the human body and moral personhood, then extends into topics such as: pregnancy and moral agency; race, genomics and personalized medicine; ageing, technology and care; disability and selective reproductive technologies; health, illness and human enhancement.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5080","eftsl":0.25}
