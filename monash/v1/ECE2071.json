It covers the language C and its implementation on a typical computer, including standard data types, arrays, control statements, functions, including ways of parameter passing, C library functions, pointers, strings, arrays of pointers, structures, linked lists and binary tree data structures, dynamic memory allocations, and calls to assembly language programs. Object-oriented programming is introduced. Software engineering is covered as the methodology of software development and lifecycle models. Operating system concepts are introduced. The unit also includes an introduction to programmable logic controllers (PLCs).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE2071","eftsl":0.125}
