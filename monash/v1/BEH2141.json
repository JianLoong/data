Students will gain valuable community engagement and participation experience through structured volunteer placements within strategically selected private, public and indigenous health related settings. Students will actively participate within these facilities in all aspects of the care programs being delivered allowing them to develop communication, listening and teamwork and skills whilst acquiring an insight into community health issues. In addition students will explore the valuable role they play as health care professionals in educating the community about the paramedics\u0027 role, and contributing to patient understanding of medical emergencies and the range of health care services and options available to them. Finally, through their community participation students will be expected to identify real or perceived gaps within the community health sector and devise strategies to narrow those gaps and achieve better health outcomes.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BEH2141","eftsl":0.125}
