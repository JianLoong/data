Therefore the interpretation of information from dietary, laboratory, anthropometric and clinical studies is central to the work of nutrition science students. In this unit, students will examine the methodological applications and limitations surrounding dietary assessment, body composition and biochemical tests. Students will be enabled to critically employ research skills when analysing nutrition related data by identifying appropriate methods, in terms of precision, validity and reproducibility for assessing dietary intake, body composition and nutritional status using biochemical tests. Students will be exposed to a number of anthropometric and dietary intake methods, as well as nutrition screening tools routinely used in both the clinical and research settings.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"NUT3005","eftsl":0.125}
