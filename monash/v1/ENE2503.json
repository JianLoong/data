The students will gain a basic understanding of the structure and properties of the main classes of materials: metals, polymers and ceramics. Students will learn about the ways in which these different materials can be disposed of, ranging from incineration, recycling and degradation, and the technologies involved in these processes. The advantages of these methods, as opposed simply to landfill, will be discussed. Methods of sorting of different materials from the waste stream into their various components will also be covered.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENE2503","eftsl":0.125}
