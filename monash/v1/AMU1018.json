It seeks to equip students with the academic skills, tertiary literacies and attitudes essential for successful university study.  The coverage of a range of key skills ranging from academic writing to critical reading is unified thematically by a consideration of what makes university study different, the benefits of a university education and the development of graduate attributes. Throughout the unit, there will be an emphasis on the utility and transferability of these academic skills and competencies for employability, lifelong learning, and to other subjects undertaken so that students can navigate their own learning. Contextualised within themes and topics, lectures will situate skills development within current research, and highlight salient principles and practices. Tutorials will involve participation in a variety of tasks, focusing on discussion, assessment, application, practice and analysis of skills development in context.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMU1018","eftsl":0.125}
