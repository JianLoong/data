It seeks to develop student\u0027s sophistication toward transportation concepts through greater awareness of modeling, materials and processes. Students have an opportunity to create 3D representation in a variety of appropriate modelling media. This enables students to evaluate how well their designs match up to particular technical and cultural requirements. Students will be expected to develop their own design proposals. Topics cover advanced aspects of 3D modelling and production processes in a variety of materials and the aesthetic aspects of transportation. Studio project work involves the development of a sophisticated piece of transportation design.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDE4809","eftsl":0.125}
