Considerable opportunities exist in this space, as comparatively little time and effort is usually invested in understanding the drivers of individual behaviour and designing solutions that target these drivers.With a mix of theoretical and practical work, this unit will enable students to understand individual behaviour in a way that identifies opportunities for change. It will take students through a process of unpacking public policy challenges and identifying real-life behavioural solutions. This involves prioritising behaviours and target audiences and understanding drivers of behaviour and potential solutions. Students will also learn to work collaboratively to design, test and evaluate behaviour change interventions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENS5520","eftsl":0.125}
