It also introduces simulation methods. First, performance modelling of a packet switch is covered. Then, a comparative analysis of routing algorithms is covered from a graph theory perspective. Third, methods to provide an integrated service to a set of traffic demands with different qualities of service are studied. Then, congestion in telecommunication networks is covered, and effectiveness of various congestion and flow control algorithms and protocols are investigated. The focus then shifts to individual links and nodes, and queuing theory is introduced and its applications in networks are analysed. Then, recent advances are studied to show how the analytical and simulation knowledge learnt in this unit could be applied in real life.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4045","eftsl":0.125}
