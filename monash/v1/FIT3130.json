A top down process focuses on requirements analysis and architecture design, which should be completed before the selection of specific network components. The unit provides students with tested processes and tools to help them understand traffic flow, communication protocol behaviour, and internetworking technologies. On completion of the unit, students are equipped to design enterprise computer networks that meet an enterprise users requirements for functionality, capacity, performance, availability, scalability, affordability, security, and manageability.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3130","eftsl":0.125}
