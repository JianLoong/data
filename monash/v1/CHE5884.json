It includes the development of constitutive relations, model building, evaluation and sensitivity analysis. Numerical techniques will include the solution of systems of linear, non-linear and algebraic equations. Models are subjected to optimisation.The basic principles of optimisation including the types of variables, linear and non-linear models, constraints and objective functions will be covered. Various optimisation algorithms for linear, non-linear problems and mixed integer problems are presented in the context of chemical process design. Multi-objective optimisation is used to explore trade-offs involved with sustainable process development.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE5884","eftsl":0.125}
