A student project involving the initial design stages of a flight vehicle will integrate these studies. Various characteristics of aircraft performance and their design implications will be examined including whole-aircraft drag polar, power plant characterisation, thrust required in level flight, maximum speed estimation, minimum speed and high-lift devices, rate of climb, gliding, range, endurance, accelerated flight, structural limitations on performance, design for longitudinal and lateral stability.  Mission analysis and preliminary weight estimation based on a design concept will be examined together with the aerodynamic synthesis to satisfy performance requirements, power plant selection, overall vehicle layout and balance.  Trade-offs as a necessary part of the design will be apparent to students on completion of this unit.","enjoyResponse":20,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE3402","eftsl":0.125}
