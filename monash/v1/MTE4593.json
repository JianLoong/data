Major technologies relating to the production, sustainable use and recycling of metals, plastics, glass, electronics, paper and ceramic materials are discussed. Various options involving materials substitution, reclamation, energy recovery and disposal are critically evaluated. The unit considers the economics of materials production, as well as \u0027cradle-to-grave\u0027 analyses of materials, including products and byproducts of the nuclear fuel cycle. In particular, it looks at various life-cycle analysis techniques. We will examine the impact of population, affluence and technology changes on population and ecological footprints with the arrival of the current \"Anthropocene Era\".","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4593","eftsl":0.125}
