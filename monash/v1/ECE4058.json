The unit describes sources of over voltage in power systems. It then presents fundamentals of high voltage insulation design and condition monitoring methods. It describes insulation performance characteristics and diagnostic methods in plant such as generators, transformers and high voltage cables. The notions of insulation co-ordination and over voltage protection are also established. Additionally, the unit introduces static electricity phenomena, hazards they pose and technology applications they bring.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4058","eftsl":0.125}
