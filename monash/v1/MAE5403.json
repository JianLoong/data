These principles will be further extended to composite airframes. The unit complements the corequisite MAE5402 thereby allowing a mature understanding of the potential synergy between structural forms and materials of construction.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5403","eftsl":0.125}
