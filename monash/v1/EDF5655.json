Over a series of modules, students explore ideas about: teaching with purpose, teaching as relationship, and teaching with emotion. The unit requires students to think deeply about the philosophical purposes that guide their practice, the kinds of educator-learner relationships they develop and the kinds of knowledge forms that they draw into their teaching and learning. This work should provoke new ideas on and application of these aspects. Participation in this unit does not rely on prior teaching qualifications but on enthusiasm for teaching.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5655","eftsl":0.25}
