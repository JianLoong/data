Clinical indications and the preparation of the patient including the correct positioning methods for the upper and lower extremity will be addressed.The purpose of the common sequences used to image specific structures will be covered and students will learn how to select the most appropriate imaging protocol for the common sequences from within an evidence - based framework.The unit will enable students to recognise the characteristics of the MRI representation of the common pathologies affecting the extremities.The unit will conclude with an examination of the application of quality assurance and quality control principles to MRI imaging of the musculo-skeletal system.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD4504","eftsl":0.125}
