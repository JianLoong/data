The media covered include vacuum/air, radio frequency (RF) and microwave transmission lines, metallic waveguides, planar optical waveguides and optical fibres.The unit also explores different types of antennas that can be used to generate the electromagnetic waves. In addition to these, the unit covers concepts related to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Using these concepts, the unit explores practical problems such as interference and coupling in RF/microwave circuits and discusses solutions such as grounding, shielding and filtering. In each section of this unit, the learned theory is related to real world applications to expand the understanding of students.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4122","eftsl":0.125}
