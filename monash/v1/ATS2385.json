This unit explores the experiences of Australians at war through the major conflicts of the twentieth century. It focuses on the \u0027face of battle\u0027 and how human conflict affected men and women on the front line. \u0027Anzac Legends\u0027 examines the role of war in both consolidating and challenging definitions of gender, national, and racial identity. In the centenary years of the First World War, this unit considers how the Anzac Legend has evolved and what it means today. As part of this unit students undertake hands-on work with the First World War repatriation records at the National Archives of Australia, a collection that tells us about the true cost of war and the battles that returned servicemen and women, their families, and the community faced beyond the Armistice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2385","eftsl":0.125}
