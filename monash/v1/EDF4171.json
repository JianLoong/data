Human movement science represents a unique discipline that explores human performance in relation to a range of movement challenges. Students develop advanced skills, knowledge and capabilities relevant to sport and exercise science that will enable them to become actors in the critique, interpretation, planning and design of existing sporting, performance, rehabilitation and health related concerns. The unit provides opportunities to examine how particular practices based upon foundational biophysical knowledge have historically emerged, been continually challenged and reinterpreted. Students gain practical experience in both laboratory and field-based settings related to the monitoring and execution of sporting, performance, rehabilitation and health-related practices.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4171","eftsl":0.125}
