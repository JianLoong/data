This unit explores what is known so far, what the key issues are in this area, and arguments around the definition of recovery, and the merits of a recovery approach, with its origins in positive psychology, mutual aid and the patient empowerment movement. The aim of the unit is to introduce the concepts and philosophy of recovery, the evidence base as it stands to date and the challenges it poses to current interpretations of existing models, in particular expert-driven treatment.Students completing this unit should be able to argue for their own conceptualisation of recovery in light of available evidence, and apply their view of recovery to current policy and practice. They will also be able to critically appraise the risks and benefits of a recovery model and be able to outline its impact for addiction, criminal justice and mental health policy and practice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"ASC5007","eftsl":0.25}
