In this unit you will learn to think and work like a professional historian. You\u0027ll research a topic from your own family history, from resources provided by Museum Victoria (MV), or from a previous unit. You\u0027ll do oral history interviews and research photos, objects, documents and other sources. You\u0027ll storyboard and script your own history video. In the final month we will work together in computer labs as each student produces their digital video, which will be placed on a Making History website and then showcased at a Museum event for students, family and friends.
