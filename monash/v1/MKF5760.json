This is regardless of the sector in which marketing leaders operate - private, public, or civil society. Hence, awareness of contemporary social issues and the role of marketing in addressing these is a critical part of the modern marketing toolkit. The approach will define the marketer\u0027s contribution as responsible and effective global leaders. In this unit you will explore various marketing concepts, frameworks and techniques ranging from social marketing to macromarketing and transformative consumer research, which can help develop such awareness and facilitate informed decision making.
