How do people get classified as indigenous or aboriginal? How has globalisation enhanced awareness of minority and human rights everywhere? The course will show how being indigenous is often a product of state politics, negotiation of identities between local, state and transnational pressure, and even of individual self-selection. We will re-examine debates over universal values versus cultural relativism, flexible citizenship and identity, and group versus individual identities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3745","eftsl":0.125}
