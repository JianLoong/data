The technologies covered will include water, soil and air quality maintenance, waste management, resource recovery, soil and water treatment and remediation and the carbon footprint of energy sources. Students will become familiar with their strengths and limitations. A first-hand experience of technological approaches to impact management, through field site visits where particular technologies are in use, is a feature of the course. Aspects of the economic and legislative issues related to the management of the environment and the use of technologies will also be covered.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENV3022","eftsl":0.125}
