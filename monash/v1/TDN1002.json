Key avant-garde movements and practices are studied, with particular consideration given to their ideological, political and cultural contexts and motives. The critical and utopian tendencies of twentieth-century avant-garde practices are considered in terms of their lasting implications for the social role of design. Students will continue to develop a range of approaches to understanding works of design and related issues, while also refining the broader critical and analytical skills necessary to their disciplines.","enjoyResponse":85,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"TDN1002","eftsl":0.125}
