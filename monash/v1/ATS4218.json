By expanding on and developing knowledge about competing ideologies and worldviews acquired in their undergraduate studies in History, the unit develops students\u0027 ability to \u0027think historically\u0027 and to recognize that ideas and ideologies - including the idea of \u0027History\u0027 itself - are historically-contingent and reflective of the values, beliefs and power structures of their time. While the specific details of what topics, periods and places to be studied in any given semester will depend on staff availability and research interests, the unit will be based around  key concepts and organizing categories such as religion, class, economics, race, gender and sexuality.  Students will be expected to read key primary and secondary texts that have informed and continue to inform ideological and belief systems, and to engage with debates about the role of ideas and values in the contemporary world.","enjoyResponse":9,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4218","eftsl":0.25}
