In this way the unit will integrate mechanical design with material selection, manufacture, and control systems, andthe needs of in-service monitoring to optimize system performance. Quality management systems, Lean techniques and Life-cycle assessment will be applied to the proposed product or service to understand system variability, maximize and maintain value-creation and assess environmental impacts.This unit uses case studies, group work and design projects as key learning methodologies to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical outcomes. Students can expect a strong practical focus with extensive use of computer aided design and analysis software.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC5883","eftsl":0.125}
