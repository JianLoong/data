It will demonstrate how the principles of evidence based health care practice apply to the specialised radiation therapy techniques of Tomotherapy, Proton Therapy, Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), and stereotactic radiosurgery/radiation therapy equipment such as Cyberknife and Gammaknife.  Students will gain in-depth knowledge of the quality assurance and physical principles underpinning each of these specialized radiation therapy techniques.  Analytical skills will also be developed in relation to the planning, treatment and verification processes for each technique. In addition, students will analyse novel dose and fractionation regimes with respect to radiobiological models.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RTP4103","eftsl":0.125}
