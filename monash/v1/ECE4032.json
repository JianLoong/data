Secondly, students are shown how to write algorithms for efficient numerical solution of these equations. Computer-aided control systems design using optimal and robust control methods is then covered. Thirdly, students are introduced to Lyapunov and function analytic techniques for nonlinear systems stability analysis, and to nonlinear control design methods including feedback linearisation, sliding mode and passivity-based control techniques.","enjoyResponse":17,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4032","eftsl":0.125}
