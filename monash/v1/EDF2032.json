Students learn how to interpret play-based curriculum that encourages children to explore, solve problems, create and construct new knowledge and explore how play is re-defined and theorised. In addition, students explore the diverse culturally informed ways in which children in contemporary society play and learn in early childhood settings, primary schools, families and communities. Importantly, students undertake an analysis of the contemporary theories of play and, noting the research upon which a variety of theories are based, examine multicultural variations, popular culture and gendered interactions. They become familiar with a range of children\u0027s play contexts. Students further develop their understanding through observing children at play and undertaking analyses of re-theorising play as a pedagogical construct to support students\u0027 ability for leading pedagogical practice change.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2032","eftsl":0.125}
