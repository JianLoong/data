The unit provides an opportunity to research issues, undertake conceptual designs and develop refinements on the basis of the advanced attainment achieved at the end of the third year.  Students should be particularly concerned with the development of their personal design philosophy, the way in which it responds to social needs and its visual and social expression as a preliminary to its virtuoso development in the major project. The contemporary discourse in industrial design and related theory is actively discussed and debated, with students encouraged to develop a personal position relative to it.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDE4117","eftsl":0.25}
