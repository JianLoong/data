This unit concentrates on these approaches, and provides examples of how they can be applied in areas such as forensic and environmental science, genomics and forensic imaging.  The remainder of the unit covers the use of spectroscopic, radiometric, separation and particle characterization techniques in automated monitoring and process analysis in a variety of industrial, clinical and environmental applications. Aspects of instrumentation, data processing and chemometrics will be emphasised in each analytical technique discussed.","enjoyResponse":35,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM3952","eftsl":0.125}
