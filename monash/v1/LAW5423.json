There may be links to foreign countries or to more than one Australian jurisdiction. The main questions considered in this unit are: when do the Australian courts assume jurisdiction in cross-border commercial disputes? when can foreign judgments in commercial disputes be recognised and enforced in Australia? what are the general principles of choosing the applicable law in cross-border commercial disputes? what are the specific rules of choosing the applicable law for obligations and property? what are the theories underlying the rules on choice of law?This unit may be of particular interest to students who are working, or intend to work, in commercial practice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5423","eftsl":0.125}
