The unit is designed to build on the undergraduate knowledge of medico-legal, ethical issues, communication and cultural competence as related to the practice of radiation therapy. Students will gain in-depth knowledge of health care regulation. Medico-legal principles relating to assault and negligence, and how these are applied to radiation therapy, will be studied and students will reflect on the impact of these in their own practice. In addition students will also examine current ethical theories and evaluate their applicability to the practice of radiation therapy. Whilst studying these topics, practitioners will be encouraged to critically reflect, analyse and synthesise relevant information from the literature, reflecting on their experiences from clinical practice to further develop and build their critical analysis skills.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RTP4101","eftsl":0.125}
