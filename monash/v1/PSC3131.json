After a review of structural elucidation via analysis of one dimensional NMR spectra, a range of more complex methods will be covered. The use of two dimensional NMR in the identification and characterisation of more complex organic compounds is introduced. Techniques for the assignment of spectra for more complex molecules will be described and the application of NMR spectroscopy to larger biomolecules including peptides will be introduced.The energetic factors which drive the processes of drug-receptor interaction will be described and energetic factors that drive the processes of drug-receptor interactions will be discussed. The use of electronic spectroscopy, including absorption and fluorescence, for measurement of drug-protein binding will be described. The uses of other biophysical techniques including surface plasmon resonance and calorimetry will also be discussed. The use of NMR spectroscopy to measure the interaction of drugs with biological molecules and the effects of chemical and conformational exchange on the appearance and analysis of NMR spectra will be described.This will involve: thermodynamics advanced NMR Spectroscopy biophysical techniques for measurement of interactions optical Spectroscopy.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC3131","eftsl":0.125}
