The unit introduces students to the fundamental aspects of the EU\u0027s legal system (legal structures, principles, institutions, law-making procedures, enforcement mechanisms, etc). The unit then examines the EU\u0027s core economic law and policies, including the single market and competition policy. The unit also investigates the EUs relations with the world, including the EU\u0027s treaty-making powers, trade policy (notably in the WTO) and the ongoing attempts to create a common EU foreign and security policy. This unit is designed for Australian and other non-European Union (EU) lawyers who, for professional or academic reasons, seek an introduction to the law and policy of the European Union. At the end of the unit students will be familiar with the legal structures and governance of the European Union, the engine of the European integration project, the single market, and the EU\u0027s relations with the rest of the world.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5302","eftsl":0.125}
