This unit focuses on how science knowledge shifts and changes over time and through technological and social change. The contemporary practices of science and mathematics, and the resultant knowledge arising from such practices, have significantly changed to become inter-, multi- and trans-disciplinary in nature. This influences the ways in which new knowledge is generated and represented through models and explanations. The unit is taught in an interdisciplinary approach, across faculties, and provides authentic learning settings in which new science practices are explored and examined. It addresses the learning of pre-service and in-service teachers as well as those who communicate science to a range of audiences. It positions educators at all career stages and across learning contexts to lead and inspire learning around science.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5674","eftsl":0.25}
