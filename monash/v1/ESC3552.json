The information extracted from remotely sensed images may be used in many ways, e.g. as abasis for mapping land use/cover, for understanding environmental processes and for estimating biophysical variables. This unit will introduce the basic concepts and principles of remote sensing, and prepare students with image interpretation and digital image processing skills with an emphasis on the use of remote sensing imagery for vegetation, atmosphere, geology, soils and landform analysis.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ESC3552","eftsl":0.125}
