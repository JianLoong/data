A diverse range of theoretical perspectives and theories, including developmental, sociocultural and post-structural, are explored in relation to how they are applied to the provision of education and care for children from birth to twelve years in their specific contexts. The unit explores new research in this field and students critically reflect on current practices in the light of this research to begin to develop their pedagogical leadership. Students apply their understanding of contemporary child development in early childhood settings to plan learning experiences showing the nexus between theory, teaching and development strategies that reflect contemporary curriculum frameworks.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2030","eftsl":0.125}
