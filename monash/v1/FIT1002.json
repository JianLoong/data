The fundamental programming concepts of the memory model, data types, declarations, expressions and statements, control structures, block structure, modules, parameters and input and output will be applied within the context of objects, attributes, methods, re-use, information-hiding, encapsulation and message-passing. Software engineering topics include maintainability, readability, testing, documentation and modularisation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT1002","eftsl":0.125}
