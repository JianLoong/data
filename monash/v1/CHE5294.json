This will require knowledge of the various categories of paper and their performance requirements, a detailed understanding of the dimensional, mechanical, optical and surface properties of paper and the influence of raw materials and process conditions on these properties, and an understanding of the relationship between the properties of paper which can be determined in the laboratory and the paper\u0027s conversion and end-use performance. It will also require detailed knowledge of the effect of relative humidity on the moisture content of paper and of moisture content on the properties of the paper, and an understanding of the consolidation of the paper web during the forming process.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE5294","eftsl":0.125}
