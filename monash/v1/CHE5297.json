This unit will examine the statistics and trends in collection and use of recycled fibre, the effects of recycling on the properties of the fibres, the flocculation of suspensions of fibres from hardwoods and softwoods and various pulping processes, factors influencing the pumping of fibre suspensions, removal of contaminants from recovered paper and virgin fibre using hydrocyclones and screens and the de-inking and brightening of recovered paper.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE5297","eftsl":0.125}
