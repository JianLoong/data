The emphasis will be on the practical interpretation of these concepts in biostatistical contexts, including an emphasis on the difference between statistical and practical significance. Classical estimation theory, bias and efficiency. Likelihood function, likelihood based methodology, maximum likelihood estimation and inference based on likelihood ration, Wald and score test procedures. Bayesian approach to statistical inference vs classical frequentist approach. Nonparametric procedures, exact inference and resampling based methodology.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"EPM5003","eftsl":0.125}
