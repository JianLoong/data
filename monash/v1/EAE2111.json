This unitprovides an introduction to the Earth\u0027s climate system and itsoperation. Students will gain an appreciation of the climate ofthe Earth\u0027s surface, sub-surface and upper atmosphere, andhow these vary in space and time. Key processes that regulatethe climate on the global, regional and micro-scale will beintroduced. The natural operation of these processes, and theiroperation with human influence, will be examined. Students willbe exposed to the techniques and instrumentation used tomeasure and monitor the atmosphere and the real-worldapplications for climate monitoring will be described. Practicalexperience in meteorological measurement will be gainedthrough laboratory classes and a weekend field trip.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"EAE2111","eftsl":0.125}
