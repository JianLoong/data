The unit emphasises the importance of community (urban/rural/local/global) resilience in changing times. Educational and development workers working for the resilience of cultures, their communities and their environments will require a wide range of specialised skills in response to emergent issues. In this unit, students examine different perspectives and languages of learning for sustainable development and critically appraise key local, national and international policy formulations, providers and expectations. The unit supports students to explore practices and approaches in order to assess the qualities and characteristics of educating for sustainable development and its contribution to sustainability.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5666","eftsl":0.25}
