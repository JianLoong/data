They consider the kinds of \u0027power\u0027 they have as an individual teacher and the teaching profession as a whole to influence young people\u0027s learning and development and to help shape a multicultural, democratic and sustainable future world. As part of that investigation students examine, critically analyse and evaluate different theories of teaching, and inquire into the multiple dimensions of teachers\u0027 work in diverse settings. In the course of developing an emerging personal and professional standpoint around teaching, students research a number of policy documents (at local, national and global levels) and consider the ways these policies influence teachers\u0027 practices and sense of who they are as professionals.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4121","eftsl":0.125}
