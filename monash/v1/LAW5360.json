Whereas the prerequisite unit, LAW 7251, canvassed the foundational insights of the Principled Negotiation and Principled Mediation models developed at the Harvard Law School, this unit extends the application of these frameworks to situations of high-level conflict and complexity and explores other models of mediation. To do this, a range of advanced-level concepts and practical tools will be introduced.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5360","eftsl":0.125}
