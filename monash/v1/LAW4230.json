It introduces students to the key legal and ethical principles and regulatory regimes that relate to our treatment of animals. The unit examines the historical status of animals in law and considers competing philosophical theories and stakeholder interests that motivate the evolution of law in respect of animals. Students will analyse a selection of regulatory regimes under Australian state and federal law that apply to our interactions with animals, which may include: animals in scientific experimentation, in sport and entertainment, and in agriculture; the live export industry; companion animals; and wild animals. Although the primary focus of the unit will be upon the law in Australia, where relevant this will be compared to overseas jurisdictions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4230","eftsl":0.125}
