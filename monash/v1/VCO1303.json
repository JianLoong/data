They will analyse how designers use pictorial images and words to convey meanings; and how they achieve this by employing a form of visual language equivalent to written language. Through studying design solutions created in contexts ranging from mainstream graphic design and advertising through to socio-political messages and imagery made by non-designers, the students will develop a referential understanding of the potential of visual language for designers. They will then be required to apply this knowledge to the making of designs employing similar problem-solving strategies.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VCO1303","eftsl":0.125}
