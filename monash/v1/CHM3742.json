The chemical processes which occur in natural and modified systems will be examined with a particular view of understanding the nature, effects and fate of pollutants. This provides students with the background to understand current issues such as air and water pollution, the enhanced greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion. Some emphasis will be placed on the analysis of air and water, and water treatment processes will be investigated for both the production of potable water as well as treatment of polluted waters.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM3742","eftsl":0.125}
