The socio-economic, cultural and historical changes rapidly experienced in the region are closely related to the use of information and communication technologies, and these will steer everyday life and the future direction of the region\u0027s development. Mediated cultural interactions are evident in digital material. The continuing development of ICTs generates unprecedented socio-cultural awareness within each of the East Asian nations, but also between them. Japan, Korea and increasingly China lead the production of new media and cultural products or content, such as reality television, dramas, computer games, and blogs. The experience of changing image and identity about self and others has been evident in the region and beyond. These will be the materials examined in this unit. How these media are related to local and international contexts will be an integral topic for exploration in the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3897","eftsl":0.125}
