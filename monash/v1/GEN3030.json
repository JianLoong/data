This unit will explore in depth the latest techniques for studying gene expression and function. This includes assaying and visualizing gene expression and protein subcellular localization in vivo, methods for artificially activating or inhibiting gene activity including generating transgenic organisms and comparative and bioinformatic methods for inferring gene function and evaluation. The application of these techniques will be demonstrated using examples of the study of the function and evolution of function of genes underlying fundamental cellular, developmental and physiological processes such as: differentiation and growth, programmed cell death, cell-cell communication, cell movement, tissue patterning, neuronal signalling and cellular homeostatis and metabolism.","enjoyResponse":32,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"GEN3030","eftsl":0.125}
