Having been exposed to an array of discipline studios over 3 semesters, this unit allows students to develop a high level conceptual approach to design problem solving relevant to their preceding studio experiences. Drawing from the design processes and methodologies developed in previous studios they are able to discover, define, design, develop and realise a unique, individualised and sophisticated design outcome. Students engage deeply with their chosen project and are able to further develop and advance their efficacy in design.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC5340","eftsl":0.375}
