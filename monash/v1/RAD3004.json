The purpose of the common sequences used to image brain structure and function will be covered and students will learn how to select the most appropriate imaging protocol for the common sequences from within an evidence - based framework.The unit will enable students to recognise the benefits and limitations of neuroimaging approaches to the characterisation of brain structure and function in health and disease.Students will be introduced to experimental paradigms and analysis approaches used in neuroimaging research. The unit will conclude with an examination of the application of quality assurance and quality control principles to MRI imaging of the brain and CNS.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD3004","eftsl":0.125}
