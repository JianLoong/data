Contemporary models of exceptionality and inclusion are reviewed and the associated skills are developed and implemented. Consideration is also given to psychosocial factors and parenting programs related to providing support to individuals who are exceptional, their families and their support workers. Practice models in line with government policy on disability assessments and related legal and ethical principles including cross-cultural issues and social justice concerns are also examined.","enjoyResponse":20,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5723","eftsl":0.25}
