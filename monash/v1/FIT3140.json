It builds upon the basic programming techniques introduced in introductory programming unit and offers the first introduction to the implementation of more complex real-world programs. Examples of such systems include compilers and interpreters, simulations, visualisation tools, drawing packages, database systems, graphical games. Such systems may be implemented in the context of non-traditional computing environments such as smartphone \"apps\". The unit may offer students the opportunity to get acquainted with a second programming language within the procedural-object oriented paradigm, such as C++, Python or one of their cousins, depending on the scope of the project chosen in a particular semester.The unit bridges between core programming knowledge and the large-scale software engineering context. It will emphasise the implementation and use of intermediate to advanced data structures (such as search trees, hash structures, graphs and graph algorithms etc.) and the embedding into an actual computing system (i.e. interacting with the O/S, networking components etc).","enjoyResponse":16,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3140","eftsl":0.125}
