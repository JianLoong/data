This unit focuses on the range of ways children encounter and use literacy in a diverse social, cultural and technological world. It introduces conceptual frameworks for understanding and critiquing the processes of how children learn about literacy. Students explore the importance of translating home and community learning into various institutional settings and vice versa. The teaching of literacy is examined from a number of current theoretical perspectives, and students develop appropriate pedagogical practices that support children\u0027s literacy learning. With a particular focus on the early years, the unit explores effective pedagogies to enhance children\u0027s oral language, reading, writing and visual literacies, taking into account issues related to information and communication technology.","enjoyResponse":37,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2020","eftsl":0.125}
