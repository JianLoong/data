The unit is the first in a sequence of studies that provides students with essential skills, knowledge and understandings to critically engage with new and established curriculum frameworks, models and pedagogical approaches. A focus on socio-critical and socio-ecological approaches and practical workshop sessions are designed to challenge students\u0027 thinking about health and physical education, introduce students to a range of pedagogies, and facilitate the application of theoretical insights to pedagogical practice. National and state curriculum and assessment frameworks provide a focus for investigation of the theoretical underpinnings of contemporary developments, and the influence of competing disciplinary perspectives and political, social and cultural factors on health and physical education curriculum texts and pedagogical practices. Exploration of international developments is used to extend insights into curriculum, pedagogy and assessment models and practices.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1071","eftsl":0.125}
