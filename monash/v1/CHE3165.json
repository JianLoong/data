The fundamental principles of mass transfer are introduced and extended to include principles of interfacial mass transfer and simultaneous heat and mass transfer. General mass and energy balances are derived for equilibrium staged processes. The applications of these principles are made to the unit operations of distillation (binary and multi-component), liquid-liquid extraction, gas-liquid absorption and stripping, adsorption and ion-exchange, and membrane separation processes.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE3165","eftsl":0.125}
