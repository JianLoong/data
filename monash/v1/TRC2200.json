It also provides a basic level of knowledge and problem solving capability in heat transfer. These disciplines are central to mechanical engineering and, as a consequence, are essential knowledge for mechatronic engineers whose designs usually have mechanical elements. Also, they provide the basis for the use of hydraulic and pneumatic power as motive forces, which also form an important part of the unit content.","enjoyResponse":50,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"TRC2200","eftsl":0.125}
