By developing problems based on clinical questions, the need and value of different experimental designs will be introduced and expanded. Within this context, issues with regards to randomisation, ethical issues, clinical study design and analysis interpretation will be developed, as will selection of outcome variables, surrogate endpoints and dealing with missing data. Efficiency issues such as sample size and power will be introduced at appropriate points in the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"EPM5007","eftsl":0.125}
