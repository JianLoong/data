Students engage with a range of educational philosophical perspectives that have contributed to understandings of childhood across time and place. Students also develop an understanding of the complex socio-economic, cultural and political contexts that have shaped childhoods locally and globally and they investigate how concepts generate possibilities and challenges for young children\u0027s learning in the present and future. Particular emphasis is given to the implications for students\u0027 work as emerging leaders in their professional field.","enjoyResponse":34,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2039","eftsl":0.125}
