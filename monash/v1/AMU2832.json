This unit is introduced in line with the aim of globalising of the University\u0027s curriculum and in making learning relevant to the learners. The objectives, apart from creating an awareness among students with regards to their postcolonial subjectivities, also opens up a critical space with which they can engage, debate, interpret and realign.
