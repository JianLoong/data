This will require the development of detailed knowledge and understanding of the chemistry of cellulose, of the various lignins and hemicelluloses and of wood extractives. This unit will examine the detailed chemistry of the various chemical pulping, bleaching and recovery processes, of the production of byproducts from pulping and bleaching operations, of the production of energy from biomass and the production of specialty chemicals and materials from biomass. It will also study the detailed chemistry of the interaction between fibres and \u0027wet-end\u0027 chemicals in an aqueous environment.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE5292","eftsl":0.125}
