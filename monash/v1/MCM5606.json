Applicants who do not have a registrable degree with AHPRA or similar will be required to have the appropriate bachelors degree or equivalent. A minimum of 2 years vocational experience in a general practice setting is essential for both Australian and International applicants. Applicants will find the assessment tasks easier and more worthwhile if they are working in a primary health care setting at least two days per week.","creditPoints":6,"rules":[{"startDate":"1/01/2014","status":"ACTIVE","ruleSummary":"TRANS","ruleString":"Unit was previously coded {MCM9306}","endDate":""},{"startDate":"1/01/2014","status":"ACTIVE","ruleSummary":"COREQ","ruleString":"Must be enrolled in course version {0099, 1759, 2677, 3900}","endDate":""},{"startDate":"1/01/2014","status":"ACTIVE","ruleSummary":"INCOMP-IW","ruleString":"Incompatible with (I/W) {DFM3006}","endDate":""}],"locationAndTime":[{"location":"Clayton","time":["First semester 2017 (Online)","Second semester 2017 (Online)"]}],"enjoyScore":3,"learnScore":3,"learnResponse":0,"proh":"","scaBand":3,"unitName":"Issues in general practice prescribing","description":"In order to prescribe in the most appropriate manner, the prescriber needs a broad perspective. Rational prescribing needs an understanding of the pressures affecting a prescriber which may influence his or her prescribing patterns. As well, the prescriber must be aware of consumer and other factors which impinge upon optimal use of medication, and the subtle and not so subtle influences of manufacturers and government. This unit aims to have such a perspective, covering topics from the practical philosophy of rational prescribing, to the future of clinical pharmacology, to the planning for quality improvement within a primary care health setting.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MCM5606","eftsl":0.125}
