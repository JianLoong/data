A small STEM practice placement will be undertaken. This practical experience provides students with an opportunity to engage as a learner in order to explore how as educators they may provide similar opportunities for authentic STEM learning experiences for others. The notion of what constitutes an authentic STEM learning experience is explored and examined. STEM education relies on the communication of STEM knowledge, processes and interaction to others and this unit provides a frame for interrogating these different communication strategies. Authentic experiences also need to be relevant to the learner, therefore what makes an experience relevant is critically examined. Additionally STEM skills, particularly creative and critical thinking, are important components of innovation and entrepreneurship. The opportunities for authentic STEM experience to provide these learning opportunities is also considered.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5304","eftsl":0.125}
