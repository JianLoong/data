In this multidisciplinary unit, students will investigate the potential of recent research into science, medicine, engineering, architecture and social science to understand these problems and to ameliorate them - to protect the environment, enhance the quality of life and promote social justice. Students will undertake a group research project related to supporting sustainability of our planet. The projects will be supervised by the appropriate faculty, but students from any faculty can do any project. The aim of the unit is for students to make a difference - to make the world a better place. At the same time, students will learn how to undertake research, and to appreciate approaches to research across the disciplines.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"SCI1800","eftsl":0.125}
