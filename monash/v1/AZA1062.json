It is designed for students who have some knowledge of French but in a limited capacity or exempted from French Introductory I requirements. Students develop language learning strategies through regularly assessed homework and class tests designed to focus on the continuous nature of language learning and emphasise the need for frequent practice. In the Specialized Culture component of this unit, students explore aspects of Francophone African cultures and develop competencies appropriate to their year level in the history of Francophone Africa through literature, film and other cultural texts. This component will also help students understand the impact of French colonisation and the complex histories of the post-colonial experience.","enjoyResponse":9,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA1062","eftsl":0.125}
