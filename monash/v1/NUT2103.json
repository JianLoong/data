The areas of pharmacology and genetics will be included as the role of nutrition in these sciences is increasingly emphasised. The key theme explored in this unit is Theme 3: Nutrition Fundamentals of Health and Disease coupled with partial integration of content and application from Theme 1: Personal Development and Professional Practice and Theme 4: Food from Science to systems. This unit will take a scientific approach to understanding the anatomy and physiology of the human body in growth and development and the impact of dietary input on cellular and metabolic processes whilst recognising the neuroendocrine control of nutrients within the body and the role of essential micronutrients in immune function. Teaching will focus on a case based learning approach to knowledge application.","enjoyResponse":34,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"NUT2103","eftsl":0.375}
