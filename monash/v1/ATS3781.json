What is considered to be \"good or bad writing\" in English, therefore, deserves thorough and critical investigation. This unit encourages students to investigate a variety of English writing practices in different societies. This should enable them to challenge the \u0027secret\u0027 behind some pedagogical feedback, as well as to discuss some key aspects/features of writing in English in international communication settings..","enjoyResponse":17,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3781","eftsl":0.125}
