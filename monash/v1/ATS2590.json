In 1900 the country controlled the largest empire in the history of the world, but two world wars, a depression, decolonization, rapid deindustrialization, as well as major civil and industrial unrest meant that by the 1970s Britain was in serious decline, in some ways the \u0027sick man of Europe\u0027. Recent years have seen a major revival in its fortunes and influence on the world stage. Drawing on a range of sources, including art, literature and popular culture, this unit traces the story of the rise, decline and re-emergence of the country across a century of rapid change.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2590","eftsl":0.125}
