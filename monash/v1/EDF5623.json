This unit introduces the key terms and concepts: education, environment and sustainability (EES) as a way of understanding environmental issues/problems, and examines the relationship between each. These concepts are important to engage with in order to develop individuals and communities capable of responding at local and global levels to rapidly changing social, economic, cultural and ecological conditions. The unit asks questions such as how has our environmental learning and education for a sustainable future been shaped by a wide range of historical, geographical, cultural and ecological factors? The exploration of answers to such questions draws on interdisciplinary approaches and critical perspectives about reconciling human-environment and culture-nature relations.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5623","eftsl":0.25}
