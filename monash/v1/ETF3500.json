In such cases, statistical tools known as multivariate methods must be used to analyse the data and drive business decisions.This unit covers such methods in three sections:   Cluster Analysis, Discriminant Analysis and MANOVA can be used to identify, predict and test for differences groups such as between distinct classes of customers or products;   Principal Components Analysis, Correspondence Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling are dimension reduction methods that help analysts to visualise complicated datasets;   and finally, Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling are used to predict and test theories and explain and predict business outcomes.","enjoyResponse":24,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETF3500","eftsl":0.125}
