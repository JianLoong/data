Students will be provided with an in-depth knowledge of radio frequency (RF) and microwave circuits and systems. The unit builds on students\u0027 basic electronic knowledge obtained from their undergraduate engineering degree to a more advanced analog and RF electronics, with more theory and applications of electronics.The unit will teach students the detailed design principles of passive and active electronic devices at radio frequencies. Students will learn to use CAD design software packages for assignments and projects. Important analogue and RF building components such as amplifiers, filters, oscillators, modulators, mixers and phase locked loops will be taught. Topics such as noise and interference in electronics circuits will also be covered.Students will undertake a group project where RF/mixed signal circuits will be designed, built and tested in the laboratory.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE5882","eftsl":0.125}
