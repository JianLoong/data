Discrete structures, such as those treated in graph theory, set theory, combinatorics and symbolic logic form the mathematical underpinning of the study of algorithms. As well-designed algorithms and data structures are essential for the good performance of an information system, an in-depth understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms is essential for any computer scientist. As importantly, the theoretical investigation of algorithms leads to a deeper understanding of problem structures and classes of problems and the knowledge of a large variety of algorithm types enables the designer to approach a new problem from different angles. Topics for this unit may include: Computability and Complexity, Automata Theory, Advanced Analysis and Design of Algorithms, Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, Numerical Algorithms, Cryptographic Algorithms, Spatial/geometric Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms and Randomised Algorithms.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT4010","eftsl":0.125}
