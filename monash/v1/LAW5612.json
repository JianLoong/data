In that respect, we will consider in detail the two major systems of dispute resolution: litigation before national courts and arbitration before private arbitral tribunals. We will analyse and compare the legal issues that may arise at the different stages of an international dispute in each of these systems and on that basis discuss the policy issues involved in each context and the considerations that will become relevant for parties when deciding which kind of dispute resolution system to choose.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5612","eftsl":0.125}
