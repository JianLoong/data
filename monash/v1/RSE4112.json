It explores the variability of rock mass strength at different scales and outlines techniques engineers can use for long-term planning and risk reduction.It also outlines the procedures used to develop, implement and maintain a Ground Control Management Plan. The ground control methodology is largely determined as a function of the interaction of various qualities of the rock mass with various aspects of the planning and design methodologies. Depending on the nature of these interactions, rock support and reinforcement is modified to achieve effective ground control.This unit focuses on defining the processes in which rock related risks are identified and managed and an individual\u0027s Duty of Care.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"RSE4112","eftsl":0.125}
