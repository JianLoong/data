It enables students to critically examine conflicts among states, firms, international organizations, NGOs and other groups over how the global economy is governed. Key questions to be explored are: How do different political and economic ideas influence global economic governance, including in trade and finance, and whose interests are privileged as a result? How have groups such as women and labour and issues such as the environment fared under neoliberal approaches to governance? Should we govern the global economy to achieve stability and efficiency, or should we also attempt to achieve justice?","enjoyResponse":22,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMU3630","eftsl":0.125}
