It covers control volume analysis of steady, one-dimensional, linear and nonlinear compressible flows. Nozzle flows. Steady, supersonic, two-dimensional linear and nonlinear flows. Linearized compressible subsonic and supersonic flow. Introduction to transonic and hypersonic flow. Control volume analysis of viscous incompressible flow, boundary layer flow and free shear flows like jets and wakes, including momentum integral analysis, similarity analysis and similarity solutions of these equations as they pertain to wall bounded and free shear flows. Application of this knowledge to simple design problems.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE3401","eftsl":0.125}
