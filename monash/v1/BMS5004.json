Current and emerging concepts relating to brain neural systems and complex behaviours will be highlighted to provide a contextual basis for discussion of the range of approaches and methods used by neuroscience researchers in studying normal and abnormal brain function and behaviour. Students will evaluate and review relevant research literature to further explore specific areas of neuroscience, from brain neural networks through to human and animal behaviour, and present this information in written forms, and via oral presentations and posters suitable for a conference presentation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BMS5004","eftsl":0.125}
