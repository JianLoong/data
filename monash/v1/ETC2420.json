A computational approach is employed to teach the concepts of statistics, and decision making in the presence of uncertainty.  An important aspect will be to develop skills for compiling data from multiple sources to support better decisions and models. Topics covered will include simulation and randomisation methods, decision and credibility theory, data wrangling and visualisation, methods for time series, Bayesian analysis and models for risk and loss distributions.","enjoyResponse":27,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETC2420","eftsl":0.125}
