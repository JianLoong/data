By tracing the history of the family from the pre-modern to modern era, it will ask a series of questions that seek to challenge commonly held assumptions about past and present families: How has the state intervened in the \"private\" realm of family life? What are the range of forms that families take and why? To what extent has the social reality of family life conformed or deviated from dominant cultural ideals? Topics may include: family life in pre-industrial settings; the nineteenth century domestic ideal and the rearing of future citizens; world wars, revolutions, and family upheaval; the sexual revolution; birth control; the feminist critique of the family; the one child family policy in China; family dissolution, divorce, and the state; new innovations in biological knowledge and technology; and the rise of unconventional families.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2108","eftsl":0.125}
