By exploring brain-behaviour interactions through an in-depth examination of a selection of cognitive abilities and behaviours, this unit will guide students to establish an understanding of the mechanisms behind cognitive control and social cognition, control of action, perception, sleep and pain. Technologies utilised by neuroscientists, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), will be considered during the course of this unit.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY4170","eftsl":0.125}
