Students learn about the major biophysical sub-disciplines including functional human anatomy, exercise physiology, nutrition and behavioural psychology. They explore the role these have played in shaping contemporary practices within the health and physical education discipline. Students learn how the biophysical elements interact with social, cultural and environmental factors to influence healthy and physically active lives. Students develop their understanding of the discipline areas through the application and critique of practice aimed to optimise individual potential for health and wellbeing, and the building of healthy, active communities.","enjoyResponse":17,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1172","eftsl":0.125}
