The course starts with passive diode rectifiers followed by thyristor rectifiers. Introducing various semiconductor active switches, commutation cells, and pulse width modulation technique, various active power electronics converters including DC/DC buck and boost converters, two-level DC/AC converters, and three-level DC/AC converters will be studied in details. Moreover, the procedure for designing various controllers for such converters will be discussed. Finally, several real-world applications such as variable speed drives, power filters, grid-tied power converters for renewable energy grid integration, and UPS systems are presented as examples.","enjoyResponse":51,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4055","eftsl":0.125}
