Students engage with, and reflect on, a range of evidence and diversity of research findings within the field of mathematics education. This includes explorations of curricular, pedagogical, learning, assessment and technology issues within classrooms and other learning settings, across the educational levels, and within other disciplines and professional contexts. International, cultural and political dimensions of mathematics education, as well as the challenges presented with respect to equity and inclusion on mathematics learning opportunities and outcomes, are considered. The relevance of mathematical skills (numeracy) in personal life and in the workplace to foster an ethical, sustainable and informed citizenry are explored.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5651","eftsl":0.25}
