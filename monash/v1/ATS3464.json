The unit introduces students to the comparative study of criminology which involves the study of crime and social control across different cultural contexts. While it may appear easy to make simple comparisons, there is a need for a far greater understanding of what, how and why a comparison is being made. This unit studies the production of criminological knowledge across cultures as well as its meaning and how we understand it. This unit it gives students the opportunity to gain on-location access to experienced professional practitioners - Judges, Police/FBI, Prison staff - in the field of criminology in the United States of America. Examples of topics for comparative understanding include: prisons and punishment, policing, social inequality and crime, immigration and race/ethnicity, organised crime/gangs, and juvenile justice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3464","eftsl":0.25}
