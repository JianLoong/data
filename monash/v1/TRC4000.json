In order complete the project studies from earlier stages of the course will be integrated into a complete design/build/test task, a computer modelling or simulation task or a combination of both. It is envisaged that the project may involve design of mechanical components, sensing, actuation and computing elements, a simulated model or similar.  Before work is started on the project a safety induction and/or risk assessment process will be completed. The student will also complete a research proposal or requirements analysis to ensure that the scope and expected outcomes of the project are agreed between student and supervisor. A progress report and a progress presentation at the end of the semester will give a detailed account of progress and a research plan for the next semester.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"TRC4000","eftsl":0.125}
