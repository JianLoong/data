This unit will cover the: loco-motor, lymphatic, cardio-vascular, and haematological systems. In addition students will also analyse and evaluate the principles of quality assurance and how they relate to the practice of radiation therapy. Students will gain in-depth knowledge on the role applications of image verification in radiation therapy treatment delivery. Students will be able to analyse and evaluate radiation therapy beam modification devices and planning evaluation tools. This unit includes one week of clinically oriented simulated learning and a four week clinical placement that will allow students to develop further clinical and professional skills to a beginner/intermediate beginner level. Whilst studying these topics, students will be encouraged to critically reflect, analyse and synthesis relevant information from the literature and reflect on their clinical experiences.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RTS5103","eftsl":0.25}
