The unit adopts a thematic approach that examines how external and regulatory factors, decision making processes, and stakeholder expectations interact to drive contemporary organisational success. Collectively, these three interrelated pillars of knowledge provide a comprehensive framework for those aspiring for challenging accounting and finance positions. Content is delivered in a weekly seminar format and draws upon selected case studies that cover topics including strategy, corporate governance, financial reporting and performance management. Given the integrative nature of the unit, assessment is primarily based on a combination of individual and group case study analysis.","enjoyResponse":42,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ACF5350","eftsl":0.125}
