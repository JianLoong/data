Students are introduced to historical and contemporary concepts, ideas, and frameworks necessary for critically reflecting on the impact of globalisation across cultures. Key to this reflection will be the development of skills in understanding institutions, cultures and people across a range of local, regional, and global contexts. The unit will enable students to identify, define and describe key global challenges and to apply the interdisciplinary knowledge gained in this unit  to critique and construct knowledge in this area.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1020","eftsl":0.125}
