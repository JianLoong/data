Students further build their conceptual frameworks for understanding children\u0027s mathematical growth. Students critically engage with current research, practice and policy in mathematics with a special focus on mathematics and play. They are introduced to pedagogical approaches that enable them to successfully support children\u0027s learning of mathematics, including a focus on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the use of real or imaginary technologies as props in their play, or as tools for designing and making meaning.","enjoyResponse":39,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2034","eftsl":0.125}
