Conceptual designs are expected to be developed to a stage that allows relevant critical analysis. Regular group and individual critiques of the project will be undertaken as the project and the thinking underlying it develop. Both the intentions of students and the results of their work are debated in group discussions and critical sessions. Students will be expected to demonstrate a strong capability to resolve and defend relevant design issues.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC4002","eftsl":0.25}
