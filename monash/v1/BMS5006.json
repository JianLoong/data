It aims to develop students\u0027 knowledge and understanding of emerging concepts on the function of the cardiovascular system in health and in disease. The pathophysiological changes in disease will be highlighted to provide a contextual basis for discussion of the range of approaches and methods used in cardiovascular science. Students will evaluate and review relevant research literature to further explore specific areas of cardiovascular science from the cellular level though to integrative physiology and pharmacology, including the whole animal, and present and/or critique topical research articles and cardiovascular case studies in both oral and written forms.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BMS5006","eftsl":0.125}
