The unit teaches the basic tools of Game Theory, and introduces a structured way to think about business interactions. Game theory originated in the middle of the twentieth century as the general study of strategic interactions and has found applications in a wide variety of contexts including economics, psychology, politics and evolutionary biology. It is this generality that is the source of its power. Accordingly, the unit  develops game theory broadly with applications to strategic situations, including business as well as more general contexts.","enjoyResponse":32,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ECF5200","eftsl":0.125}
