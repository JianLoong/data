The unit will investigate the concept of analogue reproduction, especially photography\u0027s promise to represent the \u0027real\u0027 world, and consider practices in which the real is consistently manipulated. Photography will be considered across a range of disciplines: art, ethnographic and anthropological photographs; documentary photography; and the use of photography by the legal and medical system. Finally, the unit will address the changes in the production and circulation of images evident in digital modes of reproduction.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT3440","eftsl":0.125}
