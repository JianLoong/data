It studies the specification, estimation, inference and evaluation of a range of microeconometric models. These include models for discrete, count, duration, censored or truncated dependent variables and examine issues arisen from sample selection and endogenous treatment. The aim of the unit is also for students to gain hands-on experience and computation skills for analysing large scale micro datasets. The computing package used for the unit is STATA.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"BEX4420","eftsl":0}
