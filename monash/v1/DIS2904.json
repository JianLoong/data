It builds sequentially upon the skills and knowledge of 3D design and imaging by providing a focus upon the practice and potential of 3D computer-generated modelling for product design. Students explore the creation, manipulation, composition and output of digital 3-dimensional elements with increasing confidence and proficiency across a range of options and controls available through polygon and NURBS-based software applications and the understanding of production issues associated with their output (ie. rendering, rapid-prototyping, multimedia etc.)","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DIS2904","eftsl":0.125}
