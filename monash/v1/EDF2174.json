Students critically investigate outdoor education contexts via portrayals of outdoor environments in the media, scholarship, and the outdoor education sector. This includes how portrayals and perceptions of nature, wildness, wilderness, risk, recreation and conservation influence people\u0027s attitudes, values and behaviours in the outdoors. Specifically, the unit presents a case study of outdoor learners in local and regional communities and environments and how their experiences are impacted by broader cultural belief systems. This includes a study of the social and ecological pressures placed upon specific environments due to increasing levels of settlement, industry and changes in outdoor leisure participation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2174","eftsl":0.125}
