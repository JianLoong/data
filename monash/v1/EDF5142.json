The unit extends students\u0027 knowledge, understandings and skills in health education. Students draw on research literature to critically examine a range of contemporary curriculum and pedagogical innovations in health education, including the use of information and communication technology (ICT), health literacy, critical inquiry and social action projects. Through further examination of a range of national and international health and education policies students are familiarised with current developments in theory and practice related to senior health education curriculums. Working collaboratively and independently, students consolidate their content knowledge, develop subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge and skills enabling them to provide solutions to complex educational problems in secondary schools.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5142","eftsl":0.125}
