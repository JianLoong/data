Participants undertake a number of practical activities that allow them to apply attitudes and knowledge developed across the inclusion and special education program. The activities include developing necessary resources to effectively teach learners with different learning needs, effectively teach learners in a variety of settings and working effectively with carers, paraprofessionals and other key stakeholders.
