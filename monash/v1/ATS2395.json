The unit examines how representations of foreigners and \u0027Others\u0027 have changed over time, and how these shaped Australian relations with the world. This will allow students to gain an understanding of how past issues continue to shape Australia\u0027s global relations, and how foreign, public and trade policy is developed.","enjoyResponse":27,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2395","eftsl":0.125}
