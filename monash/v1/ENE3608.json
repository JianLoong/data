The unit focuses on the processes involved in producing an EIA or EMS, with a particular emphasis on synthesizing technical, regulatory and community issues. The unit aims to encourage students to integrate their existing knowledge in environmental engineering, applying it to real projects. Through lectures, practice classes, individual assignments and group project work, students should develop skills and knowledge in preparing major EIA and EMS reports, their presentation and communication as well as their engineering context.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENE3608","eftsl":0.125}
