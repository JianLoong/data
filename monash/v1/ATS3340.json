From an outline and analysis of traditional notions of security, such as \u0027conventional war\u0027 and national security and the related theoretical paradigms of (neo) realism and liberalism, the unit will move to explore developing modes of understanding conflict and security such as \u0027non-conventional\u0027 or \u0027degenerate war\u0027, human security, and sub-state and trans-state violence.The unit will then move through a series of case studies outlining key conflict scenarios in global politics such as inter-state conflict, international armed intervention, civil conflicts, resource conflicts, and trans-national political violence. Through this, students will be able to explore the implementation of peace or conflict resolution initiatives by the international community, stemming from particular understandings of the sources of conflict, and to debate the efficacy of these.From here, this unit will focus on the UN and other intergovernmental organizations such as the EU, African Union, ASEAN and NGOs towards achieving peace. This will comprise investigation of specific approaches to conflict resolution, conflict transformation, and peace-building, including an examination of approaches to transitional justice and a critical examination of the debate around \u0027Responsibility to Protect\u0027 (R2P).","enjoyResponse":79,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3340","eftsl":0.125}
