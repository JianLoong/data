This unit introduces contemporary theoretical perspectives on the social construction of identity and on gender and sexuality as historical and social categories. These theoretical perspectives are applied to understanding and analysing everyday life and experience in a range of locations and periods. It examines the significance of understanding the formation of identity in context-sensitive ways, the intersection and construction of various social categories and their significance in political contexts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3739","eftsl":0.125}
