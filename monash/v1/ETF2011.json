Risk identification and measurement techniques most commonly used in industry are discussed, including descriptive statistics. The basic rules of probability are presented in practical contexts and as the foundation for the study of probability distributions - themselves the foundations of risk analysis models. Finally, spreadsheet models of practical situations are developed and evaluated, using simulation methods.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETF2011","eftsl":0.125}
