The three sub-units cover the following areas: Relativistic Dynamics: tensors in pseudo-Euclidean spaces, Lorentz transforms, world lines, energy-momentum 4-vectors, action and variational methods, Lagrangians and Hamiltonians, consequences of Einstein\u0027s assumptions. Electrodynamics: Magnetic induction: Ohm\u0027s law, electromotive force, time dependent Maxwell\u0027s equations. Electric and magnetic fields in matter: polarisation, bound charges, magnetisation, bound currents, linear materials. Maxwell\u0027s equations and electromagnetic energy in matter. Boundary conditions and conservation theorems. Electromagnetic waves: monochromatic plane waves in linear media; energy and momentum. Reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves. Guided waves. Classical Dynamics: The principle of extremal action, coordinate transformations, constraints and generalised coordinates. Noether\u0027s theorem, space-time and gauge symmetries. The Hamiltonian formalism, Liouville\u0027s theorem, Poisson\u0027s brackets. Canonical transformations, connection to quantum mechanics. Path integral formulation of quantum physics. Applications for classical point particles and non-relativistic fields.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHS3131","eftsl":0.125}
