When are inequalities of income and wealth just? Are liberty and equality compatible? Can a secure foundation be provided for individual rights and liberties? Must liberty take priority over other values? These issues will be discussed mainly in the light of the work of contemporary political philosophers, but some reference will also be made to classical thinkers.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2868","eftsl":0.125}
