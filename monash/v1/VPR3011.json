The unit provides students with an advanced perspective on the various modes of publication available to cultural practitioners engaged in Visual Art. This unit gives students an opportunity to incorporate theoretical frameworks that reflect and expand upon a breadth of fields that include education, business, information technology or the liberal arts into their production of visual culture. This unit asks students to develop self-directed strategies that extend upon traditional gallery based exhibition modes. These modes might include: artists\u0027 books, editioned objects; site-based research and exhibiting; digital broadcast; collaborative, social and/or performative processes; curatorial contexts; and creative arts writing. The workshop program encourages an experimental and critical approach to conceptual and material outcomes whilst providing opportunities to cultivate curatorial, critical writing and administrative skills. Students are required to initiate individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer-review. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication techniques and materials are promoted as core values in the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VPR3011","eftsl":0.125}
