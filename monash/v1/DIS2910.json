It builds sequentially upon the skills and knowledge of 2D digital architectural documentation processes by providing a focus upon spatial modeling and rendering principles and their applications. Emphasis is placed on developing students capabilities at generating virtual architectural representations, in static and animated form. This unit is undertaken as an area of specialisation within the interior architecture degree.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DIS2910","eftsl":0.125}
