Because social science research draws on people\u0027s experiences, its conduct inevitably raises ethical and political questions. In this unit, we will discuss these issues. We will also consider various qualitative and quantitative research strategies and data gathering techniques available to us when we seek to document the social world.","enjoyResponse":31,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2723","eftsl":0.125}
