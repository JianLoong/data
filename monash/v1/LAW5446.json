The first topic is media regulation, which covers the rationales for differing regulation of broadcasting, the press and private speech and the reasons for mass media law. The second topic focuses on defamation and freedom of speech, including political, commercial and religious speech and obscenity. The third topic deals with privacy and the press. The final topic investigates some advanced issues, including broadcasting regulation, the Internet and its relationship to privacy and freedom of expression, and media pluralism. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to the Leveson, Finkelstein and Convergence Inquiries.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5446","eftsl":0.125}
