Reasons for, and methods of, measuring and monitoring species, populations, habitats, communities and ecosystems are explored with the aim of addressing environmental problems such as habitat loss and species loss, and the impacts of these on ecosystem function and therefore on biological resources. Specific case studies are presented. The subject continues with the identification and discussion of factors which may affect the sustainable management of biological resources. Students will choose a case study and examine, in project work, how such factors may affect a specific conservation program.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENV2726","eftsl":0.125}
