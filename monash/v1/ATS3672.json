The course will include an overview of the development of the field and its relation to other developments in linguistics and outside of it. The main approaches used, both rule-based and probabilistic will be discussed and the basic techniques in each approach will be studied and practised. The major applications of computational techniques in linguistics, including machine translation, data mining and corpus linguistics will also be examined along with current achievements in these areas.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3672","eftsl":0.125}
