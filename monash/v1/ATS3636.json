It discusses models of secularization (freedom of religion, freedom from religion), its historical contexts, socio-cultural tensions and governments\u0027 responses to them. It examines different models implied by the intersection between the religious and the secular and between politics and the state (religious state/religious politics, secular state/secular politics, religious state/secular politics, secular state/religious politics). Finally, the unit also looks at religio-political discourses of in- and ex-clusion underlying domestic and foreign policies of nation-states.","enjoyResponse":20,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3636","eftsl":0.125}
