Topics include theoretical and philosophical analyses of the concepts of power and authority in organisational and institutional contexts in relation to decision and/or policy making, research approaches to understanding the nature of problem solving and decision making processes. The unit examines how psychological, social, and contextual factors influence and shape decision making processes and outcomes in organisations and analyses how issues associated with power and authority affect decision making and related organisational structures and processes. It also explores how organisational structures and processes might be better designed to improve organisational governance and enhance decision making intelligence and organisational capability.","enjoyResponse":11,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5636","eftsl":0.25}
