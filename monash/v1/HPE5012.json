This unit will provide you with the opportunity to explore the use of simulation as a means of learning professional and clinical skills. You will have the opportunity to examine the theoretical basis, design, planning and implementation features, and evaluation processes related to the implementation of simulation. A full range of simulated methods will be examined including case based learning, professional and clinical skills acquisition using simulated patients, authentic e-learning environments and low, medium to high fidelity clinical simulators. You will explore the characteristics of effective simulation-based educational environments, with a focus on designing simulation programs within your own context.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"HPE5012","eftsl":0.25}
