Topics include mathematical logic, formal specification languages, theorem proving and model checking. It shows how to analyse model complex software systems, how to express properties that the system should adhere to and how to use mechanical/automated proof tools to formally verify such properties.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5138","eftsl":0.125}
