This unit invites students to develop a deep and actionable understanding of their current and future role as a teacher in which they can plan for lifelong professional engagement and learning. Students develop an understanding of the value of, and engage with, professional learning communities such as professional associations with the goal of developing their own professional learning as well as contributing to the profession and shaping local and global policy contexts. Teachers collaborate, support and lead other teachers and community partners. Students develop skills in setting goals and developing strategies to lead others in collaborative and constructive small-scale professional learning projects. An important part of teaching is to be cognisant of, and work within, a diverse range of regulatory frameworks including legislation, policy, guidelines and professional registration requirements. Students locate their practice by engaging with and interpreting such frameworks as well as broader concerns of ethical and professional conduct, workplace policy and community expectations. In this unit students are encouraged to position themselves as active contributors to shaping education locally and globally.","enjoyResponse":110,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5019","eftsl":0.125}
