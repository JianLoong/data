The unit will consider the structure, development and maturation of the major organ systems in the fetus, and the means by which the fetus is able to adapt to alterations in its environment. The unit reviews the physiology of parturition (birth), the physiological changes in the fetus and newborn during the transition at birth, and the consequences of prematurity and postmaturity. The major physiological changes occurring in the mother during pregnancy are also dealt with.","enjoyResponse":58,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BME3082","eftsl":0.125}
