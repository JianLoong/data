Students will create, apply and test development tools (in conjunction with PSC3231) in the context of a real world unknown problem under the supervision of an industry mentor. Students are professionally and genuinely judged by their professional mentors and it raises their sense of responsibility exponentially and improves employability.Cases will be drawn from agrochemicals personal care products detergents paints cosmetics","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC3211","eftsl":0.125}
