The enabling sub-systems for integrated approach such as sensors and actuators, hardware interfacing, data acquisition for control and feedback of such systems, as well as strategies for risk assessment, interface definition, system integration, human integration, measurement and analysis as required in mechatronics product design \u0026 development will also be introduced.This unit would outline the breadth of the knowledge that the mechatronics systems engineer must acquire regarding the features of diverse sub-systems and components that constitute the total system.","enjoyResponse":66,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"TRC2001","eftsl":0.125}
