Particular emphasis is given to children\u0027s participation and contribution as a socio-political issue. Students engage with critical ethnography as a method for research to investigate a range of issues in relation to contemporary childhood. Sociological research questions are raised including questions about children\u0027s identity, belonging to and participation in communities, gender, environmental issues and diversity. Students engage with notions of local and global citizenship from sociological perspectives to critically reflect on children\u0027s role in society. With a focus on the present and future, students are encouraged to investigate how early years education providers are responding to the critical issues raised in the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4031","eftsl":0.125}
