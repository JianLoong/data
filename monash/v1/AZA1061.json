It also introduces students to Francophone African cultures. The unit is designed for students with very little or no knowledge of the French language. In the language section of the unit, students are regularly assessed through homework and class tests designed to highlight the continuous nature of language learning and the need for frequent practice. The specialised African Francophone cultural component will provide a medium through which not only the language, but also African societies, their histories (colonial and post-colonial) are taught within the context of culture.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA1061","eftsl":0.125}
