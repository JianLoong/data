It addresses the practical aspects of teaching and learning as informed by current theories of second language acquisition and assessment of language learning. It highlights the social nature of language use; that learning occurs through interaction and introduces students to a range of communicative approaches to teaching, learning, assessment and planning for teaching in various TESOL contexts. This includes a focus on the integration and assessment of listening, speaking, reading, viewing and writing, explicit attention to English grammar and vocabulary, an exploration of technology to support learning, and a focus on how to provide learning experiences that broaden intercultural knowledge. Students also develop an understanding of the impact of assessment practices and skills in evaluating, analysing and designing assessment tasks.","enjoyResponse":25,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5641","eftsl":0.25}
