However, raw data is of low value. Succinct generalisations are required before data gains high value. Data mining produces knowledge from data, making feasible sophisticated data-driven decision making. This unit will provide students with an understanding of the major components of the data mining process, the various methods and operations for data mining, knowledge of the applications and technical aspects of data mining, and an understanding of the major research issues in this area.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3002","eftsl":0.125}
