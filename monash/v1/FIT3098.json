In particular, the unit explores the ways in which the diffusion of ICT has reshaped thinking and practice within the workplace, communities, and society more broadly. Particular emphasis is placed upon the relationship between human activity and technology, the various ways in which the latter might replace or augment the former, and the consequences that might follow from such changes.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3098","eftsl":0.125}
