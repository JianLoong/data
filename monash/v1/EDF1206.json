Students build their capacity to apply teaching strategies to identify and address common misconceptions children have with numbers (including fraction and decimal numbers), plan and sequence lessons to maximise learning for children of varying abilities, and explore how learning can be facilitated through the effective use of digital technologies. Students also investigate and critique a range of teaching resources and reflect on their own engagement with mathematical tasks.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1206","eftsl":0.125}
