Distribution is the process that makes that happen. The primary aim of this unit is the development and management of distribution channels in order to meet your marketing objectives. The unit is designed to help you systematically analyse the various channel functions and strategies. Mastering the principles that will be discussed in this unit will also help you in understanding Supply Chain issues.
