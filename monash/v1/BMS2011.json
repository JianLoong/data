It includes an overview of  general principles of major body systems. This will be followed by a consideration of specific areas of regional anatomy from an evolutionary perspective. Namely, what distinguishes the human body from other primates, mammals and indeed vertebrates and how have these adaptations of anatomy contributed in a functional context to us being so successful.  Practical classes will involve exposure to human cadaver prosections, skeletal material, models and a range of imaging modalities including X-rays, CT scans etc.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BMS2011","eftsl":0.125}
