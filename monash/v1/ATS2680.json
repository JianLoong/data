In this unit we look critically at what it means to be literate and the processes by which we develop literacy skills in our first and second languages. A key focus of the unit is exploring how technological changes, such as the advent of twitter and the use of imbedded links on websites might affect the ways in which we process and design texts. We also consider different approaches to teaching literacy skills in schools and universities and the issues of access, power and participation embedded within them.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2680","eftsl":0.125}
