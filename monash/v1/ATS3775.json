The unit provides a structure by which students identify host organisations, compile appropriate applications, work an equivalence of 80-100 hrs within an organisation, and submit a set of reflections.  Students meet regularly with coordinator but are ultimately responsible for their own learning and must take a leading role in identifying, securing and participating in internships.Involvement within the host institution might take the form of administrative, practical and/or creative activity.  CTP has developed working relationships with a number of potential host institutions however new proposals will be considered.  Host institutions are approved on the basis of professionalism and industry standing.This unit can run at any time during the year and might fall outside semester periods.  Final submission of reflection and assessment, however, can only take place during semester.  All applications must be approved by the coordinator in advance.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3775","eftsl":0.125}
