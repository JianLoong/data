The unit will review major principles of energy conversion and the modes of heat transfer. The basic laws of thermodynamics and the governing equations for heat transfer and thermodynamics will be introduced and subsequently used to solve practical engineering problems involving thermodynamics and heat transfer. The unit will also cover fundamental design principles of power generation systems and heat exchangers.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC3454","eftsl":0.125}
