Emphasis is placed on models that address the special problems that arise when analysing microeconomic data, that is, data at the level of individual consumers, households and firms. The topics covered include modelling discrete dependent variables, modelling data sets that have both a cross-section and a time-series dimension and conducting inference in models in which the dependent variable is jointly determined with one or more of the regressors. The models taught in this unit are widely used in empirical work in economics, finance and marketing.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETS3410","eftsl":0.125}
