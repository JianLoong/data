Students will be encouraged to develop their understanding of literary humour, its varied facets (satire, parody, humour noir, stage comedy, etc.) and, equally importantly, its functions: what is specifically French in the use of humour, and what is really at stake. The unit will provide the critical tools to understand these forms of humour in their respective historical and cultural contexts, and to elaborate on the concept of \u0027comic writing\u0027 as a whole. Students will not only deepen their linguistic and cultural knowledge through the study of seminal and influential French texts and authors (from Rabelais to Vian), but will also strengthen their analytical reading skills, as well as their presentation skills and their essay-writing techniques. Students taking the third-year version of this unit will be expected to demonstrate in their work a more explicit and sophisticated grasp of the concepts germane to the analysis of the texts studied, as well as the use of a more demanding range of sources.","enjoyResponse":22,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3976","eftsl":0.125}
