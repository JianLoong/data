Key critical criminological, feminist, masculinities and queer theories are used to explore how social norms of femininity and masculinity produce particular sexed understandings of crime and criminality. Theoretical insights and contemporary understandings of the criminal justice system, popular and media representations, and development of public policy responding to sex and crime are surveyed, and critical assessments made. Topics include sex and the nature of crime; gender and policing; femininity, masculinity and violence; and, sexed and sexual violence.","enjoyResponse":35,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3466","eftsl":0.125}
