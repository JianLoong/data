The unit will include a fundamental understanding of static stress loading. It will include material degradation processes which may limit material life such as corrosion, embrittlement processes and oxidation processes. Through open-ended problems students will develop technical knowledge and professional skills.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE2167","eftsl":0.125}
