Using a combination of digital, textual, visual and cinematic sources, students will explore case studies that cohere around the themes of crime and punishment, gender and sexuality, the environment, family, race relations, the economy and national sovereignty. Covering the earliest period of British rule up to the present day, the unit examines Australians\u0027 changing relationship to place, the consequences of profound shifts in population composition and economic structures, the influences of challenges to conceptions of rights and responsibilities, and the legacy of Australia\u0027s foundation as a settler colony. It will also consider how the events historians determine as significant have changed across time.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2588","eftsl":0.125}
