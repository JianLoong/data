It focuses on understanding and developing children\u0027s thinking in mathematics from infancy through to the early years of school. The content addresses key early numeracy ideas and pedagogical strategies for enhancing children\u0027s mathematical development through play, inquiry and problem solving. Students engage with current research, policy and practice on early years numeracy and the enhancement of young children\u0027s mathematical reasoning. Students investigate tools, technologies and processes for monitoring children\u0027s thinking and fostering their mathematical progress in inclusive ways. Students reflect on their own experiences and perspectives as mathematics learners to develop an awareness of how their beliefs about numeracy influence their interactions with children. They consider strategies for their ongoing learning and development.","enjoyResponse":30,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5020","eftsl":0.125}
