Students analyse critically, evaluate and transform information from a range of curricula, including the Australian primary science curriculum and other international curricula. Specifically students recognise that knowledges are culturally constructed and they research a range of world views about science and technology. Important conceptual scientific ideas and different pedagogical approaches to the teaching of science and technology are critiqued. The preparation and teaching of science and technology programs is undertaken in the context of studying teaching strategies that are appropriate across cultural contexts, for different science and technology concepts and across year levels in primary school, early childhood settings, homes and communities.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4023","eftsl":0.125}
