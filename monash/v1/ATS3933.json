One of the tasks of the historian is to understand this interplay of culture and society, and how it manifests in different historical periods or places.  In this unit we explore the ways in which historians of many different periods (from late antiquity to the present) write about culture, from \u0027great\u0027 art to the stuff of daily life. Students will be introduced to a broad range of cultural products and their meanings, and be required to undertake in-depth research into a topic, area and period of interest of their choice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3933","eftsl":0.125}
