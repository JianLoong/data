The unit will explore some of the traditional concepts and problems of poetics, specifically in the area of the functioning of poetic language and the relation between poetic text and performance. It will include study of the following areas of interest: stylistic analysis of poetry; sound-patterning and its affective and iconic potential; metre and other kinds of rhythmic form; poetic diction; the functioning of metaphor, metonymy and other forms of figurative language; the performance of poetry.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3506","eftsl":0.125}
