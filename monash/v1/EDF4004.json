Students critically engage with various theoretical views relating to curriculum and assessment and their relationship to policy. A key focus of this unit is investigating what makes particular curricula and assessment approaches have greater or lesser educative value and the impacts of policy in these areas. Consequently, the political and ethical dimensions inherent in all curricula are explored, as are the linkages between curricula, assessment, reporting, evaluation and the quality of student learning. This unit promotes the importance of developing the professional capacity of educators to make critical judgments in terms of curriculum planning, action and evaluation, and the development of assessment that promotes high quality student learning.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4004","eftsl":0.125}
