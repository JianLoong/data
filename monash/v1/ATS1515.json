This unit is an investigation of a number of key literary and cultural texts that explore concepts of cultural difference and offer insights into diverse cultural environments. These texts produce new and provocative ways of looking at how humans have negotiated and continue to negotiate cultural identities in, transnational and global contexts. This unit offers students the opportunity to study a range of texts that bring to light connections between and among cultures.","enjoyResponse":40,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1515","eftsl":0.125}
