The scientific disciplines of exercise physiology, biochemistry and immunology will be emphasised as students critically evaluate the underlying evidence supporting benchmark nutritional guidelines and recommendations given to individuals/groups partaking in exercise. Laboratory sessions will provide practical experience of various anthropometrical, nutritional and hydration assessment techniques; alongside applying knowledge of area specific theories into practice through a kitchen laboratory session. Particular reference to the roles and responsibilities of the sport and exercise nutrition expert when working in multi-disciplinary teams will be emphasised.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"NUT3003","eftsl":0.125}
