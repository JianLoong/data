These include: How do we make our cities more habitable and sustainable? Can a city be sustainable? Who wants a sustainable city? Have cities ever been sustainable and can they be in the future? In this unit students will examine how contemporary cities around the world operate by focussing on urban processes and functions, case studies from African cities form a critical base from which to work.  Major urban problems afflicting modern cities are looked at and best practice from around the world examined.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3547","eftsl":0.125}
