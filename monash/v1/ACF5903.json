It will introduce students to accounting principles and reporting practices from a users perspective. The information requirements of two main groups are examined - external users such as owners, shareholders, investors, potential investors, and internal users such as managers. This unit provides students with an introduction to accounting and an understanding of the preparation, presentation and interpretation of financial statements.  In particular, emphasis is placed on an understanding of various business structures including control and reporting aspects of new businesses, processes, practices and policies that enable the financial performance and financial position of an entity, as displayed by the balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows, to be measured, analysed and interpreted.  Managerial accounting issues are also presented, with particular emphasis on cost management, cost behaviour, budgeting and performance measurement.","enjoyResponse":243,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ACF5903","eftsl":0.125}
