Building on the prerequisite knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus, students will learn methods for solving optimization problems, fitting models to data, stochastic modelling, discrete event simulation, and some elementary queueing theory. Application areas include traffic modelling, image processing, inventory management, logistics and other industrial problems that students will have the opportunity to consider. Assessment will include working in teams to solve real-world problems, and presenting the results to the client.","enjoyResponse":33,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MTH3310","eftsl":0.125}
