The dramatic transformations that the country experienced, including a foreign conquest, several civil conflicts, a religious revolution and the creation of a short-lived republic, will be studied with close attention to documentary sources and the art and literature of the time. We will examine how the cultural realm reflected, interacted with, and commented on the political. The unit will conclude with the restoration of the monarchy which set the scene for the creation of an English-dominated Great Britain in 1707.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3589","eftsl":0.125}
