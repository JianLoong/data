It consolidates and extends on the knowledge students have learnt from core units and other units, through experiential learning. The unit develops their understanding of the application of academically obtained knowledge and skills in a workplace environment, and facilitates their acquisition of work-based networks thereby allowing them to be involved in an area of interest. Separate internship programs are drawn up for each student who successfully applies for enrolment in this unit. Selection will be based primarily on academic merit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3744","eftsl":0.125}
