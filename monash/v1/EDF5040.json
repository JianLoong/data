This unit aims to make compelling connections between formal and other learning environments, in workplaces and communities, and considers the transitions young people make beyond schooling. Students investigate the learning and employment futures of young people and the nature of their learning transitions. The role of lifelong learning as a key attribute of wellbeing, creativity and employability is examined, as these dimensions are articulated in policy, fostered and practised in schools. Students engage with and recognise the implications of lifelong learning and its relationship to employability and enhanced workplace prospects for young people. They consider the limitations inherent in this relationship and discover ways in schools, and teaching and learning in particular, which may effectively respond to it.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5040","eftsl":0.125}
