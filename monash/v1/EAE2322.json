The unit will introduce students to concepts and processes in thebiotic and abiotic components of natural ecosystems and how humans influence these processes. This unit will provide students with an understanding how biotic and abiotic processes shape natural and managed ecosystems. The interaction between soils and vegetation, and their role in ecosystem functioning will be explored. The unit will also examine the broader-scale issues such as human and climatic influences on land and vegetation management and conservation, and interactions between the lithosphere and biosphere.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"EAE2322","eftsl":0.125}
