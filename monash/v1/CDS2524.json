Various methods and rationales - both creative and pragmatic - for the instigation of self-initiated projects will be investigated. The unit explores the possibility of communication design as an autonomous creative practice.The definition of publishing has expanded to include such diverse practices as websites, books, phone-based media, magazines, public posters, etc. In particular, small publishers have become more numerous and specialised, while traditional mass-market publishing is undergoing a slow decline. There are many examples of such small publishers being led by designers.Merging the traditionally separate roles of content-generator, editor, designer, publisher, printer and distributor reflects contemporary trends in communication design and provides a holistic overview of publishing as discipline. The unit approaches this breadth of publishing as a contiguous practice that can be overseen by an individual or small group and therefore encourages the development of projects outside of the traditional client/designer relationship.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"CDS2524","eftsl":0.125}
