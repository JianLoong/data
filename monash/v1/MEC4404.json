It allows students to more effectively use their engineering skills within the context of a business environment, and assists them to add value to the community. Students will be encouraged to evaluate problems from a multi-faceted perspective and to articulate their views in writing as well as in discussion. The unit provides a balance between global macro issues likely to influence their future work environment, and more current, micro issues likely to confront graduates in establishing themselves as professional engineers.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC4404","eftsl":0.125}
