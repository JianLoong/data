The movement of people is considered in the context of major transformations in criminal codes, labor force requirements, resources booms, and the disruptions of revolution, war and armed conflict. Groups to be studied include convicts, assisted immigrants, indentured labourers from China and India, gold-seekers, displaced persons, refugees and asylum seekers. The efforts of governments to shape their populations, through mechanisms such as transportation, the regulation and restriction of migration, deportation, internment and border control will also be studied.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2380","eftsl":0.125}
