This unit provides students with a comprehensive and clinically focused preparation and assessment for transition to practice as competent registered midwives. Students will have the opportunity to apply the theory explored throughout the course to extend and develop confidence in their practice. It is required that students will be employed in midwifery practice for a minimum of 4 days per fortnight in addition to their studies. Individual learning objectives will enable students to undertake a critique of institutional practices, policies, procedures and protocols whilst engaged in remediation, consolidation or extension of midwifery practice skills.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MID5004","eftsl":0.25}
