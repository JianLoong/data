Students will explore contemporary theoretical constructs used in social marketing and develop skills in applying procedural frameworks to formulate, manage, and evaluate social marketing campaigns. Emphasis will be given to understanding the importance of appropriately leveraging the marketing mix variables to bring about sustained behaviour change in both developed and developing world contexts.
