It analyses works by playwrights such as Carlo Goldoni, Federico De Roberto, Eduardo De Filippo and Dario Fo. The unit considers critical approaches to the prescribed texts and, using as a starting point Dario Fo\u0027s Manuale minimo dell\u0027attore, it will examine aspects of the Commedia dell\u0027Arte which have filtered through to modern theatre such as the use of the mask and philosophical issues relating to it and the function of comicality, satire and humour. Attention will be given to the response of individual playwrights to issues relating to social reality, identity and representation of reality.","enjoyResponse":9,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3241","eftsl":0.125}
