This unit examines the history and impact of global travel from earliest times until the present, concluding with questions about the future of travel. Lectures will develop a number of key themes which will be explored in detail in tutorials through the examination of specific examples and case studies. These themes will have an international focus and will include exploration, cultural encounter, pilgrimage, migration, technology, tourism and mass travel, travel imagery and writing and the environmental impact of travel.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3631","eftsl":0.125}
