Students will study the traditional use, isolation, structural characterisation, synthesis and clinical evaluation of drugs and also be exposed to newer crystallographic, computational, combinatorial and screening methodology used in drug design and development. The subject will consist of three inter-related sections: drug discovery and development, molecular recognition, and chemistry and the synthesis of biological polymers. Where appropriate, guest speakers from industry and government agencies will contribute to the subject.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM3930","eftsl":0.125}
