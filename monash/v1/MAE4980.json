Initially the engines will be treated as thermodynamic systems. A more detailed investigation of engine individual components will follow. Component integration will be examined through investigations into operation, performance and design. Methods based on thermodynamic modeling to predict engine performance will be investigated, including for gas turbines design and off-design conditions. Students will be required to undertake a significant individual project dealing with aspects of each engine.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE4980","eftsl":0.125}
