Aging is conceptualised in dynamic and innovative ways that reflect and encourage changing perceptions, theoretical understandings and possibilities of this transition phase. The impact of dimensions such as gender, class, location, diversity and spirituality on the transition phases of ageing will be explored. The notion of risk will be examined as an underlying tension in social work practice in this field.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"SWM5220","eftsl":0.25}
