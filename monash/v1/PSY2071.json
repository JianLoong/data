Students will be introduced to the basic principles of development across infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood, such as critical periods for skill development and the link between early and later development. Factors influencing development will be examined within the framework of major theories of development to understand the contribution of genetic, biological, neurological, cognitive and environmental factors. The integration of a quantitative methods module into this unit will provide students with an understanding of, and practical experience with, the application of statistical analysis techniques used to address research questions in Developmental Psychology.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY2071","eftsl":0.125}
