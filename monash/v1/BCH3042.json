Themes include basic mechanisms of cell signalling involving cell receptors, gene expression, hormones and endocrine networks, and intracellular signalling cascade. These concepts are applied to cell growth, differentiation and cell death and how the involvement of the immune system is regulated in diseases, including auto-immune diseases, cancer (and its treatment) and the destruction of T-cells after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.","enjoyResponse":34,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BCH3042","eftsl":0.125}
