Students discuss their professional projects with the unit coordinator to select and pursue a research project appropriate to their workplace context and unit requirements. Even though the professional project is self-directed, students are offered guidance, support and feedback over the course of the project. Small-group interaction is required to support students to undertake key aspects of their professional inquiry which may be conducted on- or off-campus, or a combination of both.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5691","eftsl":0.25}
