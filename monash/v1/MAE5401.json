The unit also provides an analytical derivation of boundary layer equations. Compressibility effects in boundary layer flow, flow instability and transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Introduction to boundary layer stability analysis will also be considered in detail. Introduction to the analysis and quantitative description of turbulent boundary layer flow and boundary layer flow control on aerofoils.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5401","eftsl":0.125}
