Through literature, painting, architecture, travellers\u0027 tales, cinema and other sources, it traces the development of the idea of Europe as a region defined both geographically and by its culture, distinct from other \u0027non-European\u0027 cultures. The unit will trace the idea of multiple Europes: of a culturally defined \u0027Eastern Europe\u0027; of regions within Europe, each with its own special character; and after World War II, the images of Eastern and Western Europe as politically distinct entities. The unit will conclude by looking at the impact of the European Union on images of Europe.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4296","eftsl":0.25}
