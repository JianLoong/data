Extreme poverty, inequality and social exclusion is widening within most countries and the rapid decline of our planet\u0027s health threatens the ecosystems upon which life depends. To drive an action agenda for addressing these challenges, organisations such as the United Nations have begun linking poverty reduction and inequality within the broader context of sustainability.These challenges are keenly felt in South East Asia. The study tour underpinning this unit focuses on sustainable development in the context of Indonesia, providing a local setting in which to consider sustainability meanings, priorities and solutions. We take a sociological perspective to explore the cultural contexts, structural foundations and local agency that will influence the success, or otherwise, of strategies to improve people\u0027s lives and ensure the planet\u0027s sustainability.The study tour visits different locations and organisations in Indonesia that are experiencing significant challenges, opportunities and innovations in relation to sustainable development, including food security and agriculture, climate change and energy, sustainable water, health and wellbeing, social inclusion and gender, education, sustainable economy, biodiversity and ecosystem services, governance and cities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2249","eftsl":0.125}
