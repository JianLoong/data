The emphasis is on strategic network models which are used for longer term network modelling and planning. The traditional four step models of trip generation, mode choice and traffic assignment and contemporary methods such as tour-based and activity-based modelling are introduced. The capabilities of commercial network modelling packages are reviewed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV5305","eftsl":0.125}
