In addressing these questions the subject raises important matters concerned with citizenship, individual response to public issues and the relationship between opinion and informed debate. It tracks the emergence of the theory of the public sphere, analyses the multiple uses and related applications of the concept, and explains how the public sphere relates to traditional and new communications and media environments.","enjoyResponse":61,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2440","eftsl":0.125}
