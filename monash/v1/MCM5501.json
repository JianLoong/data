Unit MCM5501 will focus on two high prevalence categories of mental ill-health i.e. depressive and anxiety disorders.Depressive and anxiety disorders are amongst the most common illnesses in the community and primary care. These conditions are mainly diagnosed and managed in this setting. As previous reports in the literature have expressed concern about the level of under-diagnosis and the \u0027low treated prevalence\u0027 of patients with mental disorders (which included depression and anxiety), the aim of this unit is to enable students to increase their skills assessing, identifying and managing patients with mental ill-health - specifically depressive and anxiety disorders.The acquisition of skills and confidence that students are expected to develop in this unit will then hopefully make a difference to clinical practice and patients, translating into better patient outcomes, both in terms of the quality of care provided and the number of affected patients that are provided with assistance.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MCM5501","eftsl":0.125}
