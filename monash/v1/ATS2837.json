N. Whitehead remarked that \u0027all philosophy is but a series of footnotes to Plato.\u0027 This unit introduces students to some of the central themes in Plato\u0027s work. These will include: the relation between knowledge, moral virtue and happiness; the immortality of the soul and reincarnation; the existence and nature of Plato\u0027s forms - abstractions such as beauty itself, alleged to be the source of all beautiful things here. Finally we will look at some of the developments of Plato\u0027s philosophy in neoplatonism.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2837","eftsl":0.125}
