This unit will explore the ways sensation relates to meaningful experiences of general significance. We will investigate questions such as the essence of the art work, the structure of perception, the notion of beauty, and the historical-cultural constitution of experiences. We will do this via studies of the aesthetic thought of major continental European philosophers of the last two centuries. Major figures covered may include Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze, Foucault, Lyotard, Kristeva, Rancire and Badiou.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3419","eftsl":0.125}
