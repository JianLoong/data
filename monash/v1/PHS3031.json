The key areas for each sub-unit are: Quantum Mechanics: QM states and the Dirac notation. Operators, measurement and observables. The quantum harmonic oscillator. The hydrogen atom, angular momentum and spin. Time evolution, periodic potentials, and perturbation theory. Identical particles. Statistical Physics: Heat, temperature and entropy. Classical and quantum statistics. Counting states and probability.  The Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein probability distributions. Applications to real systems. Laboratory work: experimental laboratory work on relevant topics.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHS3031","eftsl":0.125}
