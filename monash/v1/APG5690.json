The unit will provide students with the opportunity to analyse discourse features of the original text and compare and contrast them with the translated version. The unit also aims to develop the student\u0027s ability to translate texts of increasing levels of complexity and expertise in a variety of textual genres. A particular emphasis is given to ethical issues involved in translation.The unit combines a generic, classroom-based component, in which some of the theoretical issues from the parallel core subjects are discussed, in addition to language-specific tutorials and a fieldwork component, in which students will be introduced to translation and translating in a variety of different environments. This unit includes translation assignments tailored to individual target languages, involving the practical application of theoretical insights. Translation will be LOTE-English OR English-LOTE.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5690","eftsl":0.25}
