This period witnessed a succession of conquests by peoples who had been traditionally regarded as opponents of the Egyptian state, namely Libyans, Sudanese, Assyrians/Babylonians and Persians.  This resulted in a merging of cultural traditions and changes in administrative policies.  The unit will examine both the Egyptian response and the impact of these non-Egyptian cultures through the textual and archaeological record, including descriptions by external sources such as Herodotus.  As such the unit will explore the reception of ancient Egyptian culture in the Mediterranean and Western Asia.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3339","eftsl":0.125}
