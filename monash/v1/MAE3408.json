More sophisticated analytical methods such as root locus and frequency response will be explored and will build the foundation for controller design in the future. Modelling via state-space methods will also be briefly covered.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE3408","eftsl":0.125}
