It explores different aspects of research in science education that furthers the following perspectives:  The ultimate purpose of science education should be to improve science teaching and learning.  To improve science teaching and learning, research must be grounded in the real world of students and teachers, schools systems and society.  To improve science teaching and learning, researchers need to be open to a range of theoretical frameworks, research methodologies and strategies.  Leaders in science education require an understanding of a range and breadth of research to ensure quality in their leadership.  Research must relate to practitioners and policy makers in order for them to make leadership decisions of practical value. To deepen understanding of these perspectives, the unit explores five organising themes in science education: science learning, culture, gender and society and science learning, science teaching, curriculum and assessment, and science teacher education. Related learning theories, research methodologies and the discipline-specific nature of science in relation to education unfolds throughout these five categories.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5652","eftsl":0.25}
