It deals with the systems needed to create low-energy, sustainable buildings, including passive solar design, energy-efficient heating and air-conditioning, and combined heat and power.In addition, it includes coverage of transport energy and energy economics. Case studies from a variety of energy-focused industries such as building services, environmental engineering, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and architectural technology will be discussed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC6885","eftsl":0}
