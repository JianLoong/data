Our experience of our \u0027identity\u0027 in these contexts can be both destructive and empowering. This Unit will explore political, social and cultural approaches to understanding the politics of identity in the 21st century, the consequences that relationships have for our sense of identity, and how we can understand the variety of human actions that are shaped by these relationships.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3399","eftsl":0.125}
