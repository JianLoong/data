It consists of two 12-lecture sub-units, Advanced Quantum Mechanics and Computational Physics and a 12-hour seminar sub-unit. The key areas of study are: Advanced Quantum Mechanics: Mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, spin and orbital angular momentum, approximate methods in quantum mechanics, including perturbation theory, the WKB approximation and the variational method, formal scattering theory, and the quantum theory of radiation. Computational Physics: discrete arrays to model the space and time evolution of functions or physical systems; a hands-on approach is used throughout to develop confidence and competency in using a computer to solve physical problems. Theoretical Seminar: seminar participation in theoretical problems, projects and presentations.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHS3142","eftsl":0.125}
