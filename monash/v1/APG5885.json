The topics to be covered for interpreting exercises will have an emphasis on medicine, healthcare, tourism, business, the police/court/legal field, industry and government institutions. This unit builds on the acquisition of dialogue interpreting and on the development and reinforcement of skills and techniques needed for consecutive interpreting. Further training in note-taking, including the use of digital pen technology, will be undertaken. Sight translation is introduced as a new skill at the beginning of this unit. In the second half of this unit, simultaneous interpreting is introduced. Practice in formulaic language used in speeches and the acquisition of techniques to interpret public speeches will also form an important part of the unit. Interpreting practice in realistic situations such as simulations with guests will be arranged. It is a very intensive unit.","enjoyResponse":14,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5885","eftsl":0.25}
