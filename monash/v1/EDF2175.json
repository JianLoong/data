This includes a study of the motivations for, and responses to, outdoor experiences amongst participants from diverse groups (e.g. socioeconomic status, cultural background, age, gender and physical ability) and how conflicts over access and use of outdoor environments arise and are resolved. The study of human interactions and relationships between people and communities, and with outdoor environments, and how this influences participation, is of critical importance in outdoor education (including intrapersonal, interpersonal, eco-systemic, reciprocal, community, and kinship approaches to relationships). In this unit students complete an investigation into the relational aspects, both social and environmental, of a significant outdoor education experience.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2175","eftsl":0.125}
