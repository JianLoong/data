Emphasis is placed on structure-function relationships, and how different brain regions interact to regulate complex cognitive skills. Students also learn about the clinical neurological examination and neuroimaging, with an emphasis placed on what these methods allow us to infer regarding underlying neuroanatomy and lesions. In addition, students will learn about neurogenetics, and how genetic disorders link to variations in neuroanatomy that underpin behavioural manifestations of these neurogenetic disorders. Students learn: to identify the major features of the brain and spinal cord, using prosected specimens, models and cross-sectional images to understand the structural and functional relationships between these features to be able to apply this knowledge to the clinical situation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"DPSY5162","eftsl":0}
