Students engage critically with current research, practice and policy in literature in multiple contexts. The unit builds on the broader theoretical perspectives introduced in EDF1205 (English education 1). In particular, it addresses the importance of early literacy acquisition for future learning success and focuses on teaching approaches that build the competencies required to engage with and produce a range of texts of increased complexity. Students refine their understanding of local and national English and literacy curriculum, assessment and reporting for schools, and develop effective literacy pedagogy that will enable them to maximise the learning of diverse young literacy learners.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3219","eftsl":0.125}
