This unit will provide the opportunity to gain an understanding of the nature and use of the \"tools of the trade\" applied routinely by molecular biologists.  This includes the management of biological databases. A wide variety of applications will be explored, ranging from human disease situations to genetic modification of crop species.","enjoyResponse":84,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BTH2732","eftsl":0.125}
