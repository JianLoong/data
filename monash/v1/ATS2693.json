In a liberal democracy its role, functioning and political economy have profound implications for the conduct of politics and the nature of democracy. In this unit, the politics of the media (understood to mean the politics that goes on within the media as well as the contribution the media makes to politics) is studied from three broad perspectives. First, the politics of the media is investigated from the perspective of liberal democratic theory in order to understand the role of newspapers, electronic news media, entertainment, popular culture and so on in that which we might consider \u0027the political\u0027. Second, the political economy of the media is investigated with particular emphasis on the structure of media ownership in Australia, how this links with patterns of global media political economy, the link between media workers and media managers, and debates about foreign media ownership. Third, the unit undertakes a study of the relationship between the media and politics including studies of the dominant trends and themes in media policy.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2693","eftsl":0.125}
