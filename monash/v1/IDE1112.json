User-centered design models are considered in terms of cultural, physical, logical and semantic constraints, mapping relationships, standardisation, control and feedback factors. Methods of design communication and presentation are explored and applied.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDE1112","eftsl":0.125}
