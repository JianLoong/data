It enables complex information structures to be expressed creatively and understood quickly. Contemporary culture has seen a massive increase in the amount of data generated by social media, web sites like Amazon and other large cultural datasets. The challenge for designers, architects and artists is to translate this data into something that communicates a complex concept efficiently and creatively challenge the visual status quo to generate incisive cultural commentary.Through a process of practical studio exercises and workshops students will explore how data can be used to generate unique interactive visualisations. Students will be exposed to key processes of data management, including organising, cleaning and preparing data for visualisation. Students are encouraged to explore these processes to create dynamic, unique and creative interactive visualisations. In-depth studies of the contemporary leaders in art, design and architecture who use these processes to generate data visualisations will critically contextualise the social and economic significance of the field.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"CDS2523","eftsl":0.125}
