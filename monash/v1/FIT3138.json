Real time enterprise systems are configurable information systems packages, implemented on-line that integrate people, technology and information processing. The three integrated processes within and across functional areas are seamlessly interconnected and almost time-lag free in an organisation. Topics include systems and technology background, ES evolution, ES lifecycle, implementation and configuration, ES and electronic commerce and ES success and failure factors. The theoretical component will be augmented by detailed case studies which focus on problems faced by real-life companies. For the practical component, laboratory exercises using a well-known enterprise system will be used to deepen student understanding.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3138","eftsl":0.125}
