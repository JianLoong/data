It is essential for future workforces to be equipped with knowledge and skills for cross-cultural communications. These are part of \u0027global competence\u0027 of the workforce.For effective learning outcomes, the unit employs interdisciplinary insights from communications, anthropology, cultural studies and psychology (e.g. E. Hall, W. Gudykunst). The unit also touches upon how ethnic groups utilise the media to express their identities, with reference to migrants in Australia, e.g. Chinese, Korean, Southeast Asian migrants.","enjoyResponse":60,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2250","eftsl":0.125}
