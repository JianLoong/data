Basic concepts and physics of small-scale systems are covered. Topics include: scaling effects, nanofabrication techniques, continuum mechanical theories, low Reynolds number flows, capillary effects and interfacial flows, flows in channels of arbitrary dimensions, convective-diffusive mass transport, electro hydrodynamics including classical double layer theory, electrophoresis, electrosmosis, dielectric polarisation and dielectrophoresis. The course also focuses on device applications, specifically MEMS sensors and actuators and lab-on-chip devices, through hands-on laboratory sessions (held at Melbourne Centre for Nanofabrication).","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC4425","eftsl":0.125}
