It positions literacy practices in relationship to learning. It examines literacy/literacies across the years as a set of practices which are socially situated, developing from birth and beyond. Students explore how meanings are made and communicated through various modes, including reading, writing, speaking and viewing. Digital technologies are explored as potentially powerful ways to support and enhance positive relationships and engagement with literacy across a range of settings. Developing communicative competence in these ways connects students\u0027 out-of-school practices with those associated with schooling. Through the course of the unit, students become observers of their own meaning-making practices and reflect on connections to the shifting contexts in which they live and work.","enjoyResponse":177,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4123","eftsl":0.125}
