Students apply some of the principles and methods of educational research they have learned about by developing a short literature review related to the proposal developed in EDF4100. They then demonstrate their capacity to generate and use data ethically via a research project related to their particular discipline and specialisation. This is focused on examining practice in an education setting, school or classroom, using methods that may include focus groups, interviews, self-study, action research or participant observation. Finally, students demonstrate a clear and coherent exposition of the knowledge they have gained through the presentation of their findings to their peers and in a written report.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4101","eftsl":0.125}
