This unit deals with the legal dimension of climate change, paying due regard to its social, political and economic context. The unit will examine the development of national, supranational and international regulation, and explore how public and private actors mobilise instruments from different fields of law (such as private law, international trade law, investment law and human rights law) to facilitate or to undermine climate change mitigation and adaptation. For that purpose, examples of strategic litigation from the US, the EU and Australia will be analysed.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4679","eftsl":0.125}
