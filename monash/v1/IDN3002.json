The studio content focuses upon a student chosen design project that brings together all the learning and skill set acquisition that students have hitherto undertaken on the course. It provides the opportunity for students to demonstrate their capacity to integrate all aspects of Industrial Design project work into a holistic project; engaging design thinking, materiality, human interaction manufacturing, and communication that demonstrates professional competence. Students are encouraged to think creatively to identify a market or societal need, research and source relevant data, develop a product design specification and undertake the design of a product proposal under the supervision of academic staff. Project work is presented in folio format, documented for production. Final design proposals are also undertaken in detailed model or prototypical form where appropriate.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDN3002","eftsl":0.25}
