Then thyristor rectifiers and switched power converters are presented, looking at their use for electrical energy conversion in general and variable speed motor control in particular. Finally, single and three phase AC networks, power factor correction, and electrical power generation, transmission and distribution networks are explored. Particular focus is given here to three phase transformers, transmission line modelling, quality of electrical supply, electrical protection systems, and power system control.","enjoyResponse":142,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3051","eftsl":0.125}
