It extends students\u0027 ability to plan, enact and adjust as appropriate a range of teaching and learning strategies to meet the needs of a diverse range of learners in a variety of settings and curricula contexts. It encourages students to engage with contemporary ideas and research literature and consider the philosophy that underpins their teaching. It continues to encourage students to consider the purpose of teaching psychology in schools and psychology\u0027s place within secondary schools and focuses more on international curricula, electronic assessment, debate, learning spaces and information technologies this semester. Students develop an appreciation of how working in collaborative teams, and regularly engaging in critical conversations about teaching and learning, psychology experiences and research literature, are an essential part of the professional work of a teacher of psychology.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5176","eftsl":0.125}
