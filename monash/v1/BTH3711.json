Microbiological testing of foods is considered using current standard methods. The industrial microbiology section examines how micro-organisms are obtained, handled and maintained in industry and discusses the application of genetically modified micro-organisms. Fermentation modes and kinetic models are discussed using batch and continuous growth. Scale up and downstream processes of industrial fermentations and the role of micro-organisms in producing substances of industrial importance is discussed using antibiotics, hormones, membrane proteins and bioethanol as examples.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BTH3711","eftsl":0.125}
