The unit is divided into three distinct themes which blend together to assist in their understanding of legal principles, the application of legal standards, assessment and application of ethical practices while analysing the overarching concepts of professionalism in a challenging and continually developing area of health practice.The unit will offer a broad range of teaching and learning strategies to accommodate the variety of participants in a non-clinical setting with an emphasis in supporting students in these activities. A combination of a prescribed text written specifically for the discipline and referral articles that encompass a wider field of practice will be used in conjunction with lectures, tutorials, online discussion and research tasks. A particularly important area of activity within the unit will be applying the principles in contextualised scenarios that relate directly to paramedic practice to ensure students consider and reflect upon areas of their professional practice, beyond the purely clinical environment.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BEH1042","eftsl":0.125}
