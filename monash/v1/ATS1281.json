The causes of crime, and how it should be dealt with, are the focus of intense and on-going debate. That debate is examined in this unit. Students analyse the meaning, nature, and extent of crime, examine how crime is portrayed in the media, evaluate the effect images of crime can have on our perceptions of the crime problem, and how it should be addressed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1281","eftsl":0.125}
