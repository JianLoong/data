The course also offers a survey of the most important methodological approaches to popular culture. Topics touched on range from Immanuel Kant\u0027s theorisation of the \"Fine Arts\" to the folk music of Bob Dylan. The course concludes with the speculation that the era of popular culture is now over with the rise of the internet.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT3207","eftsl":0.125}
