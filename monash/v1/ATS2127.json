Students further develop technical skills by writing works for small ensembles, a process that extends students\u0027 knowledge of acoustic instruments, and composing works for music technology in combination with acoustic instruments. Students also explore and apply the development of musical materials in the context of multi-movement works and prepare a detailed compositional plan in response to a set concept. This prepares students to study other intermediate level compositional techniques in the next unit in the sequence, ATS2128 Composition 4.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2127","eftsl":0.125}
