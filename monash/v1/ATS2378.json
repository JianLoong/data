It explores how ethnography can improve our understanding of the development process, and the notions of human progress it rests on. The unit examines the ways anthropologists theorise social and economic patterns of change; how development policy is imagined, produced, received or resisted across multiple cultural contexts; and how development and those being developed are imagined and defined through specific case studies of approaches, institutions and practitioners in the field.","enjoyResponse":43,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2378","eftsl":0.125}
