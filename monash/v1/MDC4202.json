Students will be introduced to the TID approach to lead investigation, critical observation, and experimental practice, and develop an in-depth understanding of how the contextualization and task execution determines the overall performance of interactive systems. The major design project will be formulated to deal with various design issues such as interactivity-oriented human-factors, site and environmental contexts, and the correct use of interactive prototyping conventions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC4202","eftsl":0.25}
