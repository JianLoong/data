The unit will address the challenges and complexities for community based practitioners in the diagnostic process when managing patients with a terminal condition that involves multisystem disease and multiple health issues. It also explores the journey faced by practitioners, their patients and their carers in the transition from a cure pathway to a care pathway. The Unit encourages practitioners to draw upon their own clinical experiences and is designed to foster the development of greater clinical insight into the care of both patient and practitioner, while fostering a deeper appreciation of the strengths of team-based care.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PHC5012","eftsl":0.125}
