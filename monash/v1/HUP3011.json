Topics include tissue injury and cell death, inflammation, haematopathology, disorders of immunity, disorders of cell growth, neoplasia and pathology of infectious diseases.  Mechanisms for pathological processes are reviewed together with how these processes cause disease by overcoming normal regulatory controls.   Principles are illustrated by reference to specific diseases.  This approach provides students with an understanding of terminologies applicable to pathology and an appreciation of the causes and natural progress of human diseases.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"HUP3011","eftsl":0.125}
