Students will develop an appreciation and basic working knowledge of a number of different platforms used in contemporary games development. The unit aims to provide students with a practical insight into contemporary, industry standard, games development process and games engines. The studio environment will facilitate considerable peer interaction, in particular in the critique of game engines and the development of game prototypes.The unit provides knowledge and skills, which students can apply within their game development projects in the third year studio project/s (FIT3039/FIT3040) and across all subsequent units.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3145","eftsl":0.125}
