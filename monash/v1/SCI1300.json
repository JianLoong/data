It will affect all natural and human systems and has far-reaching consequences for society. Responding to the effects of climate change will require international and interdisciplinary approaches. This unit provides the scientific background to climate change, and it assesses the environmental and societal impacts, and community and political responses to climate change. Starting from the basic principles and processes that define and govern the Earth\u0027s climate, the unit explores how the different spheres on Earth interact to produce the rich past and current variability of climate in space and time. It then highlights how human influences are shaping the future of the Earth\u0027s climate. Equipped with the essential scientific background, the unit will then investigate what options humankind has to respond to the economic, ethical and political challenges of climate change, including global and national governance models required to mitigate and adapt to its effects. The unit will provide students with the foundation and knowledge to respond to climate change challenges throughout their career, independent of their specific discipline.","enjoyResponse":35,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"SCI1300","eftsl":0.125}
