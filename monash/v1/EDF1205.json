Students develop their own discipline knowledge of English. They are encouraged to research changing practices in the teaching of English, critically reflect on their own beliefs and teaching practices, and develop a robust theoretical perspective on the learning and teaching of literacy for a diverse range of learners. They focus on the range of ways children encounter and use symbol systems while exploring their diverse everyday worlds and building their literacy skills. Students develop understanding of relevant local and national English curriculum for schools, and the interrelated strands of language, literature and literacy.","enjoyResponse":42,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1205","eftsl":0.125}
