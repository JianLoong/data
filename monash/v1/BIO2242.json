To do this, animals acquire, process and use energy to cope with challenges in the internal and external environments through a wide variety of physiological, morphological, reproductive and behavioural adaptations. In order to understand unifying principles, we examine the amazing variety of different solutions to common problems that animals encounter. Concepts and theories in lectures are expanded and developed in interactive practical classes where animal, digital sensor and model examples are used.","enjoyResponse":62,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO2242","eftsl":0.125}
