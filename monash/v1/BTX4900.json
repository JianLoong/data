It explores ways of formulating research question(s) and hypotheses, and identifies assumptions and theories that are relevant in the development of a conceptual framework for research. The topics discussed will cover principles of legal and social scientific methods, such as relational theory, comparative law, regulatory theory, social constructivism, systems theory and critical legal theory). Stress will be placed on developing argument analysis (e.g. avoiding fallacies in reasoning, evaluating and constructing sound arguments). These discussions will clarify the theoretical and practical underpinnings of research design, inform subsequent analyses of how to select different research methods (qualitative, quantitative, mixed), and illustrate key issues associated with the main arguments development in research work. The unit will also examine ways of presenting a compelling theoretical and practical case for legal and regulatory research. Finally, students will prepare a research proposal and report.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"BTX4900","eftsl":0.25}
