It will help participants refine their strategic and conceptual skills in marketing, augment their analytical toolkits, and encourage integrative thought and action. The key question it will seek to answer is: \"how should organisations strategically create and exchange market offerings effectively to enable value for themselves, their customers and clients, business partners, and society at large?\" The perspective held would be the management of markets, with a view to achieving and sustaining market leading positions. While anchored to the viewpoint of a focal organisation, analysis would include institutions that facilitate the consummation of market exchange in an economy, and the myriad consequences of market management activity on society. The predominant pedagogy is case-based, and thus classroom discussion will emphasise strategic decision-making situations. The decision orientation will be supplemented with contemporary critical-ethical thought on marketing as a discipline of business and society.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MBA5906","eftsl":0.125}
