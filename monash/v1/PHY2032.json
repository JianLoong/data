This unit will study the role of the endocrine system in  Energy balance, metabolism and growth;  Digestion and Nutrition; and  Reproduction and Development. The first study area examines how human life requires the constant acquisition, transformation, and transportation of energy and how the endocrine system controls these processes. The second study area is the physiology of digestion, extending on to nutrition and human health. The third study area is the physiology of reproduction in males and females.","enjoyResponse":83,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHY2032","eftsl":0.125}
