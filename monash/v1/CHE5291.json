To achieve these aims, this unit will examine the chemical engineering aspects of mechanical, chemical and other pulping processes; the various mechanical pulping processes (groundwood, RMP and TMP); the traditional kraft pulping process, the equipment, instruments and process models for this process and process control; modern variants of the kraft pulping process; the kraft recovery process; NSSC pulping; chemi-mechanical pulping processes; other minor pulping processes. Bleaching processes include: traditional bleaching, elemental chlorine free processes i.e. chlorine dioxide bleaching and total chlorine free processes including oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and ozone bleaching. Processes for brightening mechanical pulps will be included.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE5291","eftsl":0.125}
