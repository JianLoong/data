Students are supported in the development of their understandings of the pedagogical content knowledge and curriculum requirements associated with their chosen disciplinary field(s), and how these vary across year levels within their area(s) in a secondary school setting. In addition, the unit enables students to develop an understanding of how authentic learning experiences, in conjunction with the use of problem-solving strategies, can be employed to enhance student learning in Years 7 to 12. Students are required to draw upon both their classroom experiences and the research literature as they actively participate in their critical construction of relevant pedagogical content knowledge at these levels of secondary school.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3269","eftsl":0.125}
