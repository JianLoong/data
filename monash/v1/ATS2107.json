Beginning at that moment of first contact in the late 15th century, this unit will trace the evolution of colonial practice in North America through comparisons between Spanish, French, and British colonial endeavours. In particular it will focus on the major settler colonial centres of New England, Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake in the 17th and 18th centuries. It will also analyse the origins and unfolding of the \"British Colonial Civil War\" from 1776-1815, which encompassed the American Revolution (1776-1783), the creation of the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights (1783-1790), and the American theatre of the Napoleonic Wars known as the War of 1812. Finally, it will conclude with a broader contextualization of the new colonial project of the United States in the so-called Age of Revolutions, when former colonies in the Caribbean and the Americas decolonized and established their independence.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2107","eftsl":0.125}
