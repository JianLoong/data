Teams will be self managed and will be a mix of students drawn from all Masters courses in the faculty.Throughout this process students will need to communicate findings, knowledge and ideas effectively and professionally to a range of stakeholders, with a range of IT knowledge, in relevant and innovative ways. The stakeholders will include academics, peers, project-based stakeholders and senior industry experts. The students will attend unit seminars, carry out research individually and contribute in a professional, committed and collegial manner to the work of their team and studio peers.","enjoyResponse":138,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5120","eftsl":0.25}
