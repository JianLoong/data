Study of how kinematic constraints are incorporated into forming the governing equations and their relationship with constraint forces. Dynamicsincorporating collisions. Using rotating coordinate systems to solve dynamics problems. Two- and three-dimensional rigid body dynamics. Consideration of nonlinearities in the dynamic response of everyday structures. Instruction on advanced topics in analytical dynamics, incorporating D\u0027Alembert\u0027s principle, Hamilton\u0027s principle and the general Lagrange equations. Reinforcement of concepts through computer analysis using Matlab or Mathematica.","enjoyResponse":9,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC4428","eftsl":0.125}
