It also analyses issues such as: What is crime? How does society decide that certain actions are criminal? What are the causes of crime? The seriousness of the crime problem; why society views corporate crime differently from street crime; how the media responds to crime; the value or otherwise of crime statistics and what effect the images of crime have on societies\u0027 perceptions of the crime problem and how it should be addressed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA1281","eftsl":0.125}
