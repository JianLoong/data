It is a full year project of either a major design, theoretical, or experimental investigation. The project may be undertaken either within the department or externally with a company or research organisation. In either case, an academic member of staff will act as the supervisor. While some projects may benefit from group based work it is expected that students will work individually on each project.","enjoyResponse":49,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC4402","eftsl":0.125}
