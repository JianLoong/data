Focus on applications of dynamics in mechatronics, with kinematics and dynamics of robotic structures, magnetoelectromechanical transducers (motors, speakers, vibration sensors, and so on). Consideration of the inevitable and critical consequences of nonlinearities in dynamic response, including limit cycles and Poincar maps and flows. Reinforcement of concepts using computer analysis on simple mechatronic systems.","enjoyResponse":9,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"TRC3200","eftsl":0.125}
