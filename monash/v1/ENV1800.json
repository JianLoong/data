It explores the flora, fauna, climate, biogeography and ecosystems of the region.  A comparison is made with the Australian environment and other ecosystems of the world.  Human impacts on the environment such as pollution, energy use, food production and human population growth are discussed and ameliorative measures explored. The field trip enables students to compare the ecological processes of three different tropical environments.","enjoyResponse":37,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENV1800","eftsl":0.125}
