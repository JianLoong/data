The project will involve a critical assessment of the current literature and will include one or a combination of design, development, and theoretical or experimental investigation work. The project plan and its outcomes will be communicated to a wider audience via a proposal, oral presentations, a progress report and a technical paper. The project may be undertaken either within the faculty or externally with a company or research organisation. This is the first part of a two-unit project.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG5005","eftsl":0.125}
