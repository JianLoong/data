Students develop an appreciation for how education for sustainability has emerged as a global priority by exploring research and curriculum content and policy including goals and agreements developed by the United Nations and other education providers in this field. Students develop an understanding of the concepts of environmental studies and sustainability and explore how these concepts are inextricably linked. They learn how to develop integrated approaches to studies of the environment and sustainability and specific related science content across primary school curriculum. Students investigate and understand the cultural, social, economic, scientific, ecological and political factors that influence attitudes and actions towards environment and sustainability. They develop theoretical, discipline-based and pedagogical knowledge and understanding of how to implement whole school approaches and classroom learning experiences for environment and sustainability at different levels of primary education.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4025","eftsl":0.125}
