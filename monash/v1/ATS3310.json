Do poems, short stories, novels and works of creative non-fiction produced in Australia affirm or challenge what we see as a uniquely Australian identity? This unit, with both Creative Writing and Literatures in English assessment options, is concerned with the contribution of literature to forming and interrogating the notions of identity, ideology, gender, ethnicity and sexuality in an Australian context. There will be an emphasis on contemporary writing, and the texts studies will include a range of literary genres. Through both critical and creative engagements, students will be invited to explore and, if interested, produce their own works of Australian writing.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3310","eftsl":0.125}
