The focus is on students developing their knowledge and skills relating to midwifery and obstetric management of these challenges. Emphasis is given to the collaborative role of the midwife, referral, use of medical technology, obstetric intervention, and the implications for women, their babies, and midwives. Whilst recognising the role of other healthcare practitioners, midwifery care will be central. Students will be introduced to the use of medical technology and obstetrical intervention whilst maintaining a woman-centred focus.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MID3000","eftsl":0.25}
