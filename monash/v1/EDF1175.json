These include geographical, scientific, aesthetic, spiritual and narrative ways of knowing. Students examine environmental land use history for particular Australian environments (inland rivers, floodplain forests and grasslands) in order to understand how different ways of knowing contribute to the attitudes and actions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and settler Australians, and how these groups have impacted upon and modified these environments. Students consider the connections between various types of land use and environmental impacts in local, regional, national and global environmental contexts.","enjoyResponse":9,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1175","eftsl":0.125}
