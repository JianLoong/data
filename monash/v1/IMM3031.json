Areas covered include development of the innate and adaptive immune system, antigen processing and presentation, maturation of the immune response, self tolerance and regulation. Advanced techniques in immunology will be presented including the relevance of genetic engineering. Skills will also be developed in searching and critically reviewing the literature, in assignment writing and oral presentation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"IMM3031","eftsl":0.125}
