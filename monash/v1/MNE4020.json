As part of the design process a range of factors based on site-specific geological, geographical and engineering conditions are considered, including surface features, layout, equipment selection, staffing and scheduling, cost estimation, risk analysis, sustainability and community expectations. Specialised design software is used for short- and long-term planning to facilitate the design process. The design is undertaken by teams which are required to prepare and present a feasibility study report. Teamwork, project management and presentations skills are assessed, in addition to the technical analysis and content of the final design.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MNE4020","eftsl":0.125}
