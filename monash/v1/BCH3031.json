Topics include global aspects of genome organisation and expression outcomes (genomics and proteomics, respectively). Other themes include the molecular diagnosis and treatment of human genetic disease using emerging technologies such as genome mining and novel gene therapy strategies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BCH3031","eftsl":0.125}
