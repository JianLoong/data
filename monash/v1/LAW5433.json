After assessing the meaning of victimization, the unit focuses on what justice means to victims, differentiating between retributive, expressive and restorative justice and exploring the tensions that may inhere between various communities of victims. It also provides detailed analysis of the variety of post-conflict accountability mechanisms: trials, truth commissions, civil proceedings, amnesty, customary dispute resolution, and reparations. It also covers the law and jurisprudence of the International Criminal Court, and other international tribunals, in terms of victim participation in criminal proceedings, victim reparations, and victim damage claims. In addition, it will include case studies and discussion of how disempowered groups become enmeshed as agents of violence during episodes of mass atrocity.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5433","eftsl":0.125}
