Students extend and synthesise their understanding of conceptual frameworks, which reflect the complexity of children\u0027s mathematical growth across the curriculum. They research the challenges associated with mathematical content in diverse contexts, and are expected to research, adopt and design pedagogical approaches that support and challenge children to be mathematicians. Approaches which stimulate conjecturing, testing and mathematical justification are introduced and modelled, researched and critically analysed. Students critically engage with current research, practice and policy throughout the unit.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4037","eftsl":0.125}
