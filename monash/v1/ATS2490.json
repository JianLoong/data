The primary focus of this unit is the development of an extended individual project focusing on analysis and development of communication in a current organization.  Further professional writing skills are developed through the documentation of the project (pitches and briefs, bench-marking and final delivery reports, written and oral).   As the expectations of communication in organisations and the modern world are also rapidly evolving, the unit is also designed to further students\u0027 conceptual understanding of key issues in professional communication such as multi-modal-literacy, inter-cultural communication, and changing practices of reading, writing and text creation.  This knowledge will complement students\u0027 work in other media and professional communication studies as it enables a consistent and thorough approach to media text construction.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2490","eftsl":0.125}
