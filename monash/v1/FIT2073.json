Utilising the principles taught in this unit, students will be given the opportunity to design innovative game applications and implement the consequences of their decisions as working game prototypes.The combination of theory and practice in this unit is geared to equip students with the skills to not only design innovative games, but also to critique existing games and importantly new game ideas. The studio environment will facilitate considerable peer interaction, in particular in the design, communication, and critique of new game ideas. The unit provides knowledge and skills, which students can apply within their game development projects in the third year studio project/s (FIT3039/3040) and across all subsequent units.","enjoyResponse":48,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT2073","eftsl":0.125}
