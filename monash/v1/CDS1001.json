Students develop a repertoire of knowledge through the exploration of creative problem solving methodologies and manipulation of design elements. Communication design is presented as a creative, analytical and synthesising process with social, cultural and artistic implications. Set projects encourage experimentation and skill development with materials and technology via drawing, image making and various digital imaging software options.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"CDS1001","eftsl":0.25}
