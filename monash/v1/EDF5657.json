The unit is underpinned by an appreciation of critical race theory, strategic planning and international developments in the recognition of the social and economic rights of Indigenous peoples. The unit extends students\u0027 knowledge and understanding of Indigenous cultures with a particular focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, their histories, cultures and languages, and of the impact of culture, cultural identity and linguistic background on organisational capacity to deliver world-standard service provision. To develop such capacities, the unit introduces students to emerging approaches and research in organisational development strategies to improve and evaluate service provision to Indigenous peoples. Drawing on these, students develop a strategy to engage people from Indigenous and traditional communities and improve outcomes in a particular professional setting.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5657","eftsl":0.25}
