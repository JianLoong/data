Areas examined include the molecular biology of plasmids and genetic elements such as plasmids, transposons, integrons and pathogenicity islands, recombination and DNA repair mechanisms. The ability of bacteria to control gene expression in response to extracellular signals will also be examined, as well as the intracellular transport and secretion of macromolecules, and some aspects of bacterial genomics.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MIC3011","eftsl":0.125}
