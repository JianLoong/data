The unit features health from an African perspective. Students will gain an understanding of professional knowledge and the power associated with that knowledge and the way it is exercised. Areas examined will include risk assessment and management; public and private health and health promotion; HIV/AIDS and sexual health and the influence of the media and the internet on health related matters. The unit will embed these learning objectives in the African context introducing students to African interpretations of health, illness and medicine.
