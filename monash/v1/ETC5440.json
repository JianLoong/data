The discussion is motivated by reference to econometric and statistical techniques, and simple practical examples with which students should be familiar. It is shown that GMM finds application in many areas of econometrics and business statistics, and that GMM may be viewed as a methodology that encompasses many econometric and statistical techniques. Broad topic headings are: Classical Method of Moments and Regression (OLS and IV), GMM, Identification, Asymptotic Distribution Theory for GMM, GMM and Optimal Inference.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETC5440","eftsl":0.125}
