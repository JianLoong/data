It will focus on the processes of constructing history and memory, with a particular emphasis on the memorialisation of defining events of the 20th century, i.e. the two World Wars, the Holocaust, and/or the Spanish Civil War. The unit will also explore the theoretical debates on memory (by authors such as Walter Benjamin, Maurice Halbwachs, Pierre Nora, Aleida and Jan Assmann, Marianne Hirsch, and/or Giorgio Agamben), and the role of literature in constructing collective memory. In examining the literary, historiographical and philosophical concepts students will become acquainted with a broad range of texts on this topic.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3040","eftsl":0.125}
