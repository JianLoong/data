Various modes of recent art practice will be explored: from postcolonial performance to the boom in Asian art, and from art as fashion to the development of the curator as a kind of artist and the exhibition as an art work. Students taking this course will also be introduced to the major discourses and writers in art theory since 1989, and the role of art within its broader social and cultural contexts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"TAD3105","eftsl":0.125}
