Design elements. A deconstructed look at the world. Students undertake weekly exercises that lead through the \u0027grammar\u0027 of shape, form and line. They practice expressing these things through drawing and the exploration of abstract interpretations in card, paper and foam. Early explorations of the same in a simple form of CAD (e.g. Google sketch-up). Cardboard structures are built to explore early understanding of structure balance and geometry in static objects. This unit explores the nature of design by introducing the characteristics of space, objects or images as appropriate, as part of a designer\u0027s repertoire of knowledge and understanding. Basic design studies provide the framework for the development of a language of design.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDN1001","eftsl":0.25}
