The unit introduces participants to alternative conceptual frameworks for describing and analysing health systems, and focuses in particular on one - \"the control knobs framework\" - which describes the key levers of a health system and how these levers work to influence outcomes of interest such as equity, cost, financial risk protection and quality of care. The control knobs framework is used to describe and analyse health system outcomes in developed and developing countries (including Australia); diagnose existing policy reform challenges; shed light on ongoing health policy debates; and assess a recent case of reform in the health sector.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MPH5308","eftsl":0.125}
