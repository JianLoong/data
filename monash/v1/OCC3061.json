Students examine a range of health promotion strategies, their strengths, limitations, evidence-base and application in clinical care and community settings for occupational therapy. Through a focus on empowerment, participation and capacity-building, students develop skills for working with individuals, community networks, new technologies and the mass media to facilitate health promotion action. This unit covers planning and evaluation of health information and behavioural interventions, health education for empowerment, community engagement, social marketing, professional communication and advocacy for healthy public policy. Students critically analyse the challenges and opportunities for integrating health promotion into occupational therapy practice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"OCC3061","eftsl":0.125}
