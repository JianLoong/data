The unit begins with a review of univariate statistics and an introduction to the philosophy of research design and analysis. More advanced statistical techniques are then systematically introduced. There is a focus on the understanding of the issues that may arise around the choice of appropriate statistical technique and preparation of data, critiquing decisions made to assist in the interpretation of findings. The content will be set in a context of the needs of professional psychologists and researchers whose interests present unusual methodological demands, which in turn may influence choices in research approach and statistical technique.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY4210","eftsl":0.125}
