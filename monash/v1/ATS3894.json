It begins with a historical examination of the ways in which groups have been discriminated against on the basis of race, ethnicity, age, religion, gender, social status or sexual preference. It then explores attempts to create a more just and tolerant society and questions whether mainstream society is willing to accommodate the needs of minority groups.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3894","eftsl":0.125}
