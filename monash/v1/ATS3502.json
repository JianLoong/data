We will be especially interested in tracking formal experiments and thematic developments in this period in light of world-historical events and shifts in the relationship of writers and readers. There will be a focus on 21st century literature, with the aim of asking questions about how canons get made, movements establish themselves and interpretations become standard. Topics and themes might include: irony and sincerity; metafiction; maximalism and minimalism; 9/11 literature; the death and return of the author; the rise of creative nonfiction;; the impact of \u0027Theory\u0027 and Creative Writing programs on literature and criticism; book ends and book futures.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3502","eftsl":0.125}
