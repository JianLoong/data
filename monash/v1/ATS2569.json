It offers selected coverage of major events and developments in Australian history and also considers how the discipline of history operates across different domains - academic, public and popular. By focusing on major themes such as war, depression, memory, political and social conflict the unit takes an in-depth look at specific issues in Australian history that have provoked debate and controversy. By focusing on points of difference or conflict we begin to understand the deeper themes and characteristics of Australian history and its scholars. We will also consider how history and historians have made an impact on the public sphere.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2569","eftsl":0.125}
