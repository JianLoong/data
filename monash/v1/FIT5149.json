Students will be introduced to established and contemporary Machine Learning techniques for data analysis and presentation using widely available analysis software. They will look at a number of characteristic problems/data sets and analyse them with appropriate machine learning and statistical algorithms implemented in software including R, Python and RapidMiner. Those algorithms include regression, classification, clustering and so on, and the focus is on understanding the problems, models, and use of software, but not in the underlying theory. They will need to interpret the results and the suitability of the algorithms.","enjoyResponse":21,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5149","eftsl":0.125}
