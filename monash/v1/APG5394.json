The unit also deals with the ethical problems raised by new reproductive research and biomedical technologies, such as embryo experimentation, cloning, genetic counselling, genetic therapy and genetic engineering. There will be discussion of a range of philosophical problems central to these issues, including the sanctity of life doctrine, notions of potentiality, the nature of personhood, the acts/omissions distinction, and the definition of death.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5394","eftsl":0.25}
