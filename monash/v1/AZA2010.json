Ideologies offer explanations for the problems with the status quo, and advocate a programme for creating a better world. They can exert a powerful hold on their adherents, and clashes between ideologies have resulted in terrible wars. As a result, it is important to understand what different ideologies say. In this module, students will learn to identify and evaluate a variety of ideological traditions. This course will introduce students to the \u0027classical\u0027 political ideologies of liberalism, conservatism and socialism. It will also discuss newer ideological trends, such as feminism, green politics, and religious fundamentalism. This will equip students with the knowledge to understand the undercurrents of democratic politics.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA2010","eftsl":0.125}
