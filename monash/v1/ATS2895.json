Has the influx of women into media industries changed the \u0027news\u0027? How is gender implicated in newsroom culture? Why do  men continue to dominate positions of power in most media organisations? Students also explore the coverage of  indigenous and ethnic issues in mainstream media, and the rise of indigenous and ethnic media in Australia. Students are introduced to key issues in feminist media scholarship, and Journalism Studies, while also critically engaging with contemporary journalism practice and the news media\u0027s relationship with, and responsibility to, indigenous and ethnic issues. Its overarching focus, however, is to explore gendered newsroom culture in this rapidly changing, intensified global industry.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2895","eftsl":0.125}
