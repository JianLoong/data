Drawing on a range of national and international literature, the unit introduces students to current debates and trends in media education practices. Students investigate the different justifications for teaching media studies in secondary schools, and critically inquire into the benefits and dangers of different approaches to teaching media studies. Bringing together theory and practice, students examine different approaches to teaching key media studies topics, including representation, narrative, new media and media production. Students apply their knowledge of these topics to evaluate media studies teaching resources and to design and implement individual lessons and assessment tasks for diverse students at a range of levels with an awareness of national and international curriculum documents.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5163","eftsl":0.125}
