This unit introduces the essential algorithms, theory and programming concepts necessary to generate interactive 2D and 3D graphics. Students will gain practical experience using the industry standard OpenGL API to develop their own interactive graphics applications. The topics covered form the basis of core knowledge necessary for developing applications in scientific visualisation, virtual reality, visual special effects and computer games.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3088","eftsl":0.125}
