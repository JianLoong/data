It includes digital and physical fabrication for design outcomes relative to the nominated studio specialisations of Interaction Design, Multimedia Design and Collaborative Design. The unit focuses on the technical and practical capabilities required for the creation of design prototypes. Students will be introduced to the interdisciplinary nature of design technologies and equipped with fundamental design skills and methods through project work and a series of hands-on exercises. Students develop a repertoire of knowledge through the exploration of the concepts, methodology and vocabulary for production, publishing, presentation and prototyping techniques relative to their studio specialisation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC4550","eftsl":0.25}
