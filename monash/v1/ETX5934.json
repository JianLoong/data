The approach is based on linear regression theory, and emphasises \u0027hands on\u0027 data analysis. Topics studied will include properties of least squares estimators, hypothesis testing, the choice of appropriate functional form, the use of dummy variables, issues around modelling survey data and the problems of serial correlation, heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity. Students will learn how to critically analyse empirical economic studies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETX5934","eftsl":0.125}
