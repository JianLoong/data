It will also offer a survey of the various attempts to theorise the new medium of photography. The unit will conclude with a detailed consideration of the new \"digital\" era we are now living in, in which not only is \"photography\" the dominant artistic medium and technique but the whole world becomes in effect \"photographic\". Today it is arguable that \"photography\u0027 in the form of the digital not only determines the making of images but also their circulation and reception.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT2440","eftsl":0.125}
