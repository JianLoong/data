The major strengthening mechanisms involving interactions of dislocations with obstacles are discussed This unit examines the factors that are important in influencing the structural and chemical changes and the principles for microstructrual design. It demonstrates how to use the design principles to manipulate, in a controlled manner, the alloying additions and thermomechanical processing to tailor the properties and thus the performance of materials.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE3542","eftsl":0.125}
