These debates concern the nature and foundations of law, the relationship between law and justice, the nature of legal reasoning and the role of value-judgments and creativity in judicial decision-making, the meaning of statutes and constitutions, and judicial activism and fidelity to law. Students will also study how philosophical debates about these issues illuminate actual controversies in the practical administration of legal systems.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4137","eftsl":0.125}
