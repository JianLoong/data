The increasing pace of globalisation in the 21st century is closely related to the centrality of communication for culture, and its relevance in terms of politics, trade, social and cultural change.This unit will examine the continuities of digital media with, and divergences from, previous media and the role they play in the increasingly connected globe. Through developing around a distinction between international and transnational communication, it looks at the changing role of the nation-state with regards to media policy, international trade and politics, and contrasts this with discussions of community, diaspora, and intercultural communication.Case studies from Southeast Asia and other regions will be used as source material, as a basis for discussion, as well as for further research.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMG5400","eftsl":0.25}
