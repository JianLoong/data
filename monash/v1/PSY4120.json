It will focus on the aspects of mental health and illness that integrate traditional clinical information (e.g., symptoms, prevalence, etiology, conceptual models, etc.), neuroscience, behavioural science, and evidence-based treatment options. The broad scope of mental health and illness will be reflected in the choice of topics, and these topics may change to reflect current issues in the field. The general area from which the specific topics may be chosen might include: specific psychopathologies (e.g., depression, anxiety, addiction), trans diagnostic concerns in mental health (e.g., sleep, relationship factors), and mental health in operational settings. The unit aims for students to build an appreciation for the fact clinicians need to be informed by research ranging from basic neuroscience to clinical trials, and researchers need to be mindful of the translational potential of their work.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY4120","eftsl":0.125}
