{"preqs":"Students in non award programs (single unit / cross institutional enrolment): Applicants must have a medical degree or other health practitioner degree and be currently registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), or a similar local national registration body. Applicants who do not have a registrable degree with AHPRA or similar will be required to have the appropriate bachelors degree or equivalent. A minimum of 2 years vocational experience in a general practice setting is essential for both Australian and International applicants. Applicants will find the assessment tasks easier and more worthwhile if they are working in a primary health care setting at least two days per week.","creditPoints":6,"rules":[{"startDate":"1/01/2014","status":"ACTIVE","ruleSummary":"COREQ","ruleString":"Must be enrolled in course version {0099, 2677, M6006}","endDate":""}],"locationAndTime":[{"location":"City (Melbourne)","time":["First semester 2017 (Online)","Second semester 2017 (Online)"]}],"enjoyScore":3,"learnScore":3,"learnResponse":0,"proh":"","scaBand":3,"unitName":"Chronic disease management","description":"This unit aims to give students broad understanding of the current and future impacts of chronic disease management on primary care, together with knowledge of models and systems of response, and particular skills to use in their workplace.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MFM5004","eftsl":0.125}
