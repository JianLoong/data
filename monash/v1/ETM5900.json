Students should also be able to effectively communicate the results of their analyses. This unit covers descriptive statistics for revealing the information contained in data; probability as a tool for dealing with uncertainty; probability distributions to model business behaviour; confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing techniques for single populations; analysis of relationships between variables using simple linear regression; and simple tools for forecasting time series data. Applications to critical analysis of business and economic data will be emphasised.
