Students are introduced to key theories and debates from academic disciplines such as education, sociology, psychology, media studies and social policy. Through these, students come to see a complex array of forces shaping everyday use through to education practice, policy and design. The unit raises key issues such as identity, cybersafety, globalisation, equity, and emerging forms of social practice. Students critically explore the discourse surrounding educational technology from mobiles to eLearning. The unit challenges thinking about how the educational technology of the near future may be more efficiently and equitably shaped. It is designed for all students regardless of their level of familiarity with computers.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5647","eftsl":0.25}
