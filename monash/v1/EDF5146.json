It provides students with opportunities to continue developing their advanced knowledge and skills relevant to teaching information and communication technology (ICT) but with a particular emphasis on senior levels in secondary schooling. This includes: the use of technologies to represent understandings, conceptualise and manage ideas, to create and communicate, to engage critically with the impacts of technology on society and education and to develop an understanding of the relationship between ICT curriculum content and pedagogy. The unit also considers how we can sustain professional learning and the role of the ICT teacher more broadly in the school and in shaping policy.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5146","eftsl":0.125}
