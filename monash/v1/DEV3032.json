This will be followed by the characteristics and basic biology of newborn and adult stem cells. Subsequently inducible pluripotent stem cells will be introduced. The characteristics, anatomical location and clinical relevance of stem cells in specific tissues are then described, including haematopoiesis, kidney, gut, prostate, limb regeneration and immune, nervous and reproductive systems / mechanisms of fertility and infertility. Students also conduct a research project in stem cells and developmental biology. Two moderated classroom discussions on commercialisation, recent technological advances, and/or regulatory and ethical issues of stem cell research and clinical treatments are also included.","enjoyResponse":27,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"DEV3032","eftsl":0.125}
