Students will use a range of sensing technologies to gather real-time information and use industry standard approaches to data analyses, characterisation, fault assessment and reporting methodologies at various stages of product design and product development.Data visualisation will also be discussed. The unit will explore frequency of monitoring in relation to the volume of data collected and strategies for data reduction.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC5882","eftsl":0.125}
