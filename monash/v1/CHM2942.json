In this unit students will be able to apply their knowledge by examining chemical processes in a biological context: the relationship between stereochemistry and biological activity; transition states of enzyme catalysed reactions; molecular mechanisms underlying glycoside bond formation and breakage; describe the chemical reactivity of organic and inorganic molecules and the reactions occurring at different functional groups; develop a basic understanding of bio-conjugate chemistry and its applications; classical and contemporary bioinorganic chemistry of metals; metal coordination chemistry; molecular mechanisms for redox potentials within living systems; metalloproteins and co-enzymes; transport and storage of naturally occurring and toxic metals; role of metals in medicine; applications of modern bio-spectroscopic and bio-imaging techniques; visualisation and monitoring of chemical processes occurring in living tissues; processing bio-imaging and bio-spectroscopic data.","enjoyResponse":17,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM2942","eftsl":0.125}
