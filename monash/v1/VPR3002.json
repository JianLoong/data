In this unit students will focus on their chosen areas of interest reflected in their choice of workshops. Topics will include curatorship, arts writing and a range of contemporary art approaches. A high degree of independence, combined with advanced conceptual lucidity and prowess in the development of curatorial, collective and individual practices should be evident at this stage. Students develop final individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their personal direction and evolving practice, that provide a bridge to the broader arts industry.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VPR3002","eftsl":0.25}
