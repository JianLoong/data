The unit will start by introducing the reasons, uses, and purposes of assessment. Specific methods (e.g., observation, objective performance, parent-report) related to the assessment of children will be reviewed.  Particular attention will be paid to issues related to family-centred practice and assessing children in naturalistic environments. Different contexts (e.g., clinic, community, school, home) where assessment is completed, issues related to the assessment of children at different age levels / developmental levels and the evaluation of children with special needs will be discussed. Ethical, policy and legal issues related to the assessment of children will be presented and critiqued. Specific types of assessment tools, scales, and instruments appropriate for use with children will be presented and reviewed. This will provide a broad base of knowledge and skills for occupational therapy students wishing to work with children and families in clinical, educational, home, and community settings.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"OCC4131","eftsl":0.125}
