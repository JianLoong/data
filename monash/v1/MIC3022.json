The focus will be on human and animal viruses and will include the most up-to-date research as well as areas of major worldwide concern, such as emerging viral infections. The molecular properties used by different viruses for infection, replication and transmission will be presented. Theory will be underpinned by practical experiments that will provide experience in working with viruses, in addition to a variety of current hierological techniques used in research and diagnostic laboratories.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MIC3022","eftsl":0.125}
