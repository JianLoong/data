By providing opportunities for students to participate in leading industrial projects, designing interactive artefacts, systems or services, students will be exposed to specifically situated problems and evaluate innovative solutions that weave together technology, place and product with specific intents in specific contexts.The unit encourages experimentation and skill development with tangible materials and interactive technology via data gathering, analysis, evaluation and design. Students will produce publication quality designs which examine the extension of physical artefacts and tangible interface as elements of connectivity that help users to mediate between the information world and everyday life.The project supports students in a broad range of interests, including the application of advanced technologies, electronics and programming, physical or virtual interface manipulation, and material and engineering fabrication.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC5202","eftsl":0.5}
