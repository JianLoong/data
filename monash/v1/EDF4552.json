In particular, students are supported in the development of their understandings of the learning demands associated with their chosen disciplinary field(s) and in the examination of the levels of pedagogical sophistication that are required to teach within their area(s) in a secondary school setting. This unit enables students to draw upon the content and pedagogical knowledge they have developed over their participation in this course to work towards the development of pedagogical content knowledge that is appropriate for their chosen disciplinary field. Students are required to draw upon both their classroom experiences and the research literature as they actively participate in the construction of relevant pedagogical content knowledge.","enjoyResponse":30,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4552","eftsl":0.125}
