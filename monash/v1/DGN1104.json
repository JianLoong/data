The project work uses simplified professional projects to ensure students start to consider all aspects of design problems. The projects involve the use of brief, analysis of requirements, design problem solving methods, synthesis of design resolutions and communication of design solutions. The primary concern in the subject is for the student to be able to overcome the project constraints in order to integrate the range of requirements and issues, and achieve a holistic design that addresses human needs.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DGN1104","eftsl":0.125}
