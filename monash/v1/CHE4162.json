The unit begins with understanding particle characterisation, the fluid mechanics of single and multi-particle systems and particulate fluidization. The physics underlying powder flow will be covered to enable introductory hopper design. Common powder processing operations will be studied, selected from powder mixing/segregation, sedimentation, dewatering and size enlargement.","enjoyResponse":70,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE4162","eftsl":0.125}
