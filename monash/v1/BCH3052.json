Major themes relate the various levels of protein structure to their wide ranging functions, introduce modern techniques used in the analysis of structure and function, and explore the rapidly developing area of protein-related biotechnologies and drug design. Topics to be covered include examples of aberrations in protein structure that lead to alteration in function in a variety of biological contexts, emphasizing disease.  Additionally the use of bioinformatics in aiding our understanding of protein sequence, structure and function will be highlighted.","enjoyResponse":31,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BCH3052","eftsl":0.125}
