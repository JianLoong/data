Relevant methods for 2 x 2 and 2 x k tables extended into logistic regression for a binary outcome as a special case of generalised linear modelling. Measures of association and modelling techniques for ordinal outcomes. Methods for analysing count data. Techniques for dealing with matched data e.g. from case control studies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"EPM5009","eftsl":0.125}
