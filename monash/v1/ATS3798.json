Students at Monash will work simultaneously with students in Warwick to share particular knowledges and deepen their understanding of local, regional, national and transnational approaches to the texts. Questions of \u0027authority\u0027 and \u0027authenticity\u0027 in Shakespearean production will be addressed alongside issues such as the politics of translation, the influence of notions of \u0027high\u0027 and \u0027low\u0027 culture and the impact of technological innovation on the development of performance forms. As the dissemination of performance across cultures and technologies will be a key consideration of the unit, students in both domains will work together in real time on practical performance exercises and share the development of a creative project.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3798","eftsl":0.125}
