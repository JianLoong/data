We examine questions such as: When, if ever, is warfare justified? What about humanitarian intervention? What about violent revolution and terrorism? Why should civilians be protected in conflict? These issues are linked to the situation in Africa, with particular reference to some of the vexing dilemmas encountered within this context, such as terrorism, dictatorships and civil war. This unit will introduce students to theoretical approaches to the ethics of conflict that will allow them to answer these difficult questions. It will also serve to introduce students to basic ideas in moral and political philosophy. No background in philosophy is required: merely an interest in rational argument applied to global conflict.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3640","eftsl":0.125}
