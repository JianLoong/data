Students will become familiar with at least one standard statistical package. Topics covered include: parametric and nonparametric procedures to compare two independent and matched samples; review of simple linear regression; multiple linear regression - analysis of residuals, choice of explanatory variables; model selection and validation; nonlinear relationships; introduction to logistic regression; basic principles of experimental design; one-way and two-way analysis of variance models; planned and multiple comparison techniques; power and sample size considerations in design; usage of some available statistical packages including Minitab and/or SPSS, data preparation, interpretation of output.","enjoyResponse":47,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"STA2216","eftsl":0.125}
