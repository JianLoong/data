It is designed to provide an opportunity for talented undergraduates from all disciplines and areas across Monash University to work together in multidisciplinary research teams, encompassing not just their peers at Monash but also fellow undergraduates at other world class universities in Singapore, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Students acquire and hone highly sought-after skills in research and leadership; identify and develop research synergies across disciplines; learn to write up their research for different publication genres including refereed journals; develop competency and agility to work in a global, cross-cultural environment; and refine their ability to communicate complex research findings and ideas to intelligent multidisciplinary audiences.
