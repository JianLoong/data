Students research and critically analyse a variety of theoretical perspectives around social, cultural, emotional and language development, and other factors that mediate and influence the child\u0027s ability to participate and contribute in diverse contexts. The focus of this unit is on the development of skills that facilitate processes of researching and critically analysing, theoretically informed pedagogical strategies to support children through change and transition. By researching the traditions, routines and practices of children\u0027s life worlds, students are given the opportunity to develop a deep understanding of children\u0027s learning and development in diverse and complex contexts. Students explore possibilities for ethical, innovative and collaborative work with families and other professionals to enable children\u0027s mobility and agency across experiences of change and transition.","enjoyResponse":41,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3033","eftsl":0.125}
