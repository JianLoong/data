The unit elaborates on architectural design as a process of investigation, critical observation, and experiment. It increases the emphasis on design as a synthetic process encompassing a range of complex issues inherent in the production of architecture: material, structure, program, site, history and representation are investigated in their relationship to the production of architectural form.Architecture Design Studio 4 continues to enhance the development of architectural designs through the three-dimensional and material testing of ideas. Studies in the unit will maintain their focus on developing an understanding of design as a visual language and process of cultural production with a focus on social and environmental sustainability.","enjoyResponse":24,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"ARC2002","eftsl":0.25}
