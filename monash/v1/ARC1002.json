The synthesis of a range of complex issues inherent in the production of architecture: material, structure, program, site, history and representation is further investigated in relationship to the production of architectural form.Architecture Foundation studio 2 further emphasises the development of architectural designs through the three-dimensional and material testing of ideas. Students will continue the development of two and three-dimensional modes of representation. Studies will focus on developing a more nuanced understanding of design as a visual language and process of cultural production with a focus on social and environmental sustainability.","enjoyResponse":53,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"ARC1002","eftsl":0.25}
