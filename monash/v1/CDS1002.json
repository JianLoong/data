An understanding of how communication design enhances the human experience is initiated in this unit through observation, critical enquiry, interpretation and the creation of visual and interactive forms. Students will utilise typography both as a communicative and expressive tool. Historical and contemporary examples of visual communication, typography and time-based media will be examined, analysed and discussed, providing the opportunity for students to appreciate and develop skills in typography, page layout, motion graphics and digital media design.","enjoyResponse":47,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"CDS1002","eftsl":0.25}
