Students are provided with opportunities to explore integrated approaches to learning and teaching which utilise overarching ideas to link conceptual understandings and skills from a range of curriculum areas. This builds their capacity to develop innovative teaching practices that enable diverse student populations to meaningfully engage with science alongside other discipline areas. This unit emphasises the nature of science as a particular way of thinking about, interacting with and making sense of phenomena. It explicitly connects this endeavour with the philosophical, moral and political dimensions of whole-school, community practices and global concerns. By drawing on contemporary curriculum developments and theoretical perspectives nationally and internationally, students develop understanding of the possibilities, potential and challenges inherent in using integrated approaches to science education. In association with their professional experiences in schools, students are required to imagine, develop, critically evaluate, and apply integrated approaches to curriculum to enhance their teaching of science and to engage learners with science in meaningful ways.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4252","eftsl":0.125}
