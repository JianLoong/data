The project is a self-quided learning task involving either a major design, theoretical, experimental, computational or analytical task involving a significant literature review. An academic staff member will act as supervisor. Students submit for assessment  a research paper and final report on the outcomes of their project work and give an oral presentation. A substantial proportion of the assessment will be based on the final thesis document.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5410","eftsl":0.125}
