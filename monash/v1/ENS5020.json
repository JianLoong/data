How sustainability is viewed and addressed is shaped by a diversity of multi-stakeholder perspectives and value systems along with their capacity to influence economic, regulatory, and policy regimes.This unit develops student\u0027s capacity to map and critically analyse: multi-stakeholders and social structures affecting sustainability; different ideological, cultural, philosophical, psychological and disciplinary perspectives on sustainability; and, their implications for policymaking, development of business cases, disciplinary research, and action.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENS5020","eftsl":0.25}
