Through practicalproblem solving it will introduce methods and techniques used inenvironmental and climate science to collect and analyse data, to buildquantitative models and to visualise key results. The unit will discuss anumber of environmental and climate science problem-based topicsinvolving observing and modelling the earth. Simple techniques andmethods from the fields of mathematics, physics and informationtechnology will be introduced successively in the context of real-worldproblems and will enable students to apply these necessary skills inthe higher level units in the Environmental Earth Sciences and ClimateScience majors.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"EAE2011","eftsl":0.125}
