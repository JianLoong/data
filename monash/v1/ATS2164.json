These self-discoveries are usually cast as positive but are on occasion of a more unsettling or disturbing kind. The unit will  investigate why Italy has been a key site  of renewal and \u0027undoing\u0027 in literature and will track the changes in the way such transformations of the self have been achieved. It will also account for the popularity of such narratives with readers past and present. In this unit there will be an emphasis on \u0027geo-located\u0027 reading experiences and writing exercises. For this reason there will be a particular focus on \u0027Tuscan transformations\u0027; we will visit the actual sites and scenes of our texts and there will also be regular in situ writing excursions in Prato and surrounds.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2164","eftsl":0.125}
