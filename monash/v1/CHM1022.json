Along the way, students will discuss the formation of inorganic coordination compounds and investigate their role in colour and magnetism, and metals in biological systems. The concepts developed within the workshops and tutorials are complemented through a laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.","enjoyResponse":314,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM1022","eftsl":0.125}
