It looks at laws and policies concerning identity, dispossession, protection, assimilation and \u0027intervention\u0027 or \u0027emergency response\u0027. It will examine over-representation of Indigenous people within the criminal justice system, deaths in custody, the \u0027stolen generations\u0027 issue, land rights, native title, and customary law. The experience of Indigenous Australians is focussed upon as a \u0027case study\u0027 but significant comparison is made between this experience and that of other Indigenous people in particular in Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia. The unit also considers human rights, self determination, reconciliation, law reform and human rights issues.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5451","eftsl":0.125}
