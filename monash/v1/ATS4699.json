A diverse range of community organisations interact with various criminal justice institutions and seek to reform and improve access to justice and substantive justice for offenders and/or victims. These organisations typically engage with policy issues and undertake and utilise research to inform their work and to create pressure for change. The unit engages with criminal justice organisations and institutions in order to critically examine the policy environment and the potential of research to impact on criminal justice.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4699","eftsl":0.25}
