The first section will explain the interdisciplinary fundamentals of money and currencies, including the historical background, economic theories and the role of law. The second section will introduce international monetary law, focusing on the work and functions of the IMF, which has played an increasingly major role in addressing global financial and sovereign debt crises. The third section will cover the monetary integration process in Europe, and a thorough examination of the European Monetary Union (EMU). The unit will conclude with a critical assessment of the much-debated recent developments within the EMU set in motion by the European sovereign debt crisis, including the implications for countries such as Greece and Germany.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5630","eftsl":0.125}
