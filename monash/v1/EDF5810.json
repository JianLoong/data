VCAL focuses on pedagogies to engage students in their schooling with the aim to increase participation in Years 10 to 12 of schooling and build pathways into further education and employment. Pathways approaches to schooling rests upon teachers drawing academic, VET, community and work-based learning opportunities together to meet the diverse learning needs of students who do not engage with the mainstream curriculum. In this unit, students develop the skills, knowledge and capabilities to enhance participation and create pathways. More specifically, students examine the curriculum requirements of VCAL and explore the ways in which the VCAL subjects (literacy and numeracy, personal development, industry specialist study and work-related skills) can be taught and assessed. In addition, students become familiar with VET and other general education options and their relationship to VCAL.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5810","eftsl":0.25}
