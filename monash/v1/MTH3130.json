Additional topics from algebraic and low-dimensional topology may include fundamental group and Seifert-van Kampen theorem, classification of surfaces, and topics in knot theory. Throughout, examples of spaces will include Euclidean spaces, surfaces (real projective plane, Klein bottle, Mobius strip), complexes, function spaces, and others.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MTH3130","eftsl":0.125}
