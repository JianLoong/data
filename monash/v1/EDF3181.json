Students engage with culturally diverse ways of knowing by creating a range of place-related artworks that critically inform notions of art, place, identity and sustainability. Students\u0027 own art experiences, e.g. drawing studies, site specific installations, nature prints, castings and photo-media works, serve as a catalyst for the planning and implementation of an art, environment and sustainability project for a local community, e.g. kindergarten or early childcare setting, school, community or outdoor activities.","enjoyResponse":48,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3181","eftsl":0.125}
