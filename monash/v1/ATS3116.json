The unit shows a particular concern with \u0027new\u0027 Indonesian writing but also positions this writing within its historical, cultural and literary context. Students engage with a range of literary texts and Indonesian language styles (e.g. youth, ethnic) and gain an understanding of why and how authors vary their language.
