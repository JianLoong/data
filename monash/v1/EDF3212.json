There is a focus on content in the measurement and geometry strand from Foundation to Year 8 of the Victorian Curriculum F-10 and the Australian Curriculum. Students engage with and critically reflect upon activities and approaches for developing understanding, fluency, problem solving and reasoning capacities associated with shape, using units of measurement, location and transformation, and geometric reasoning. Students engage with research on how children learn measurement and geometric principles, design a unit of work that addresses common misconceptions, and develop appropriate formative and summative assessments for this unit of work.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3212","eftsl":0.125}
