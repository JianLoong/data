An important note in contemporary scholarship on the contemporary interaction of law and religion has been that there is not a single \"secular\" but, rather, varieties of secularisms. A close study of the various ways that political power, law, and religion have been configured provides a unique and valuable line of sight into comparative legal traditions, constitutional structure, and legal and political theory. Some of the most interesting contemporary legal and political debates have arisen out of questions about freedom of religion, its limits, and the just relationship between religion and the state.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4656","eftsl":0.125}
