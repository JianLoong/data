Popular culture, in this instance, is considered as a directive as well as a reflection of collective ideology. The genre of manga and anime, television and film, music, fashion and food cultures provide the contexts for students deepening their understanding of Japan\u0027s postwar cultural history; the role of new media and technology in society; personal identity as expressed through consumption and lifestyle; and important cultural expressions of socio-political resistance to hegemony.","enjoyResponse":26,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3951","eftsl":0.125}
