The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. The first third of the unit examines some essential recent work on the liberal conception of justice and equality. The second part of the unit looks at socialist, feminist and communitarian critiques of liberalism. The final third of the unit is concerned with the foundations and limits of religious toleration and individual freedom in a multicultural society. These topics are linked to society in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the political problems and dilemmas encountered within this context.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3869","eftsl":0.125}
