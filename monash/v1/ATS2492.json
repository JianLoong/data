The unit will pay particular attention to the complex representation of gender and sexuality in the period. Shakespeare\u0027s plays will be considered in relation to the various interpretations which have been applied to or imposed upon them by critics and directors over the years, and how these reflect changing times and fashions as well as political and cultural biases.","enjoyResponse":16,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2492","eftsl":0.125}
