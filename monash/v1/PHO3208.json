In consultation with the lecturer, students will propose and research a theme of individual interest and will produce a folio of work to a high standard on this theme. In addition to the project, students define, research and articulate their work through an accompanying research paper. Students will express an understanding of the implications of media choice, presentation and the nexus between visual and conceptual aspects of photomedia.
