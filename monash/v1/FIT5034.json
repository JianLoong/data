While todays network technology has come a long way in terms of high-speed data transmission, secure management components, and software-driven administration, QoS targets have come to the fore as converged technologies have taken over both enterprise and home users of network technologies. This unit will provide students with fundamentals and theoretical foundations of Quality of Service and management aspects of modern network infrastructures. On the basis of industry best practices, research- and experience-driven standardisation, this unit will cover topics pertinent to delivering quality, security, manageability and other targets that are relevant in large-scale networks. Students will also acquire practical skills needed to plan, install, configure and manage networks through laboratory activities and projects.","enjoyResponse":16,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5034","eftsl":0.125}
