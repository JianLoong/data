At one level, it can involve water harvesting, co-generation of power or the use of alternative/renewable power sources but at a more fundamental level, it requires us to design smart, adaptive structures and devices.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC5884","eftsl":0.125}
