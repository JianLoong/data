Topics include the cytoskeleton, the formation of the membranes, the intra-cellular trafficking of proteins, the cellular internalization/export of proteins. Over-riding themes of this subject are: to view the cell as a dynamic unit composed of a series of interacting organelles to understand the cell as a semi-independent biological entity in constant contact and communication with the extracellular environment and with other cells in multi-cellular organisms.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BCH3021","eftsl":0.125}
