Pragmatics is concerned with how speakers use linguistic forms in particular contexts to communicate more than the semantic content of those forms, as well as how their addressees draw inferences in order to arrive at a shared understanding (or not!). This unit considers the nature of linguistic meaning and how it can be best represented, drawing on natural language data from around the world.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2674","eftsl":0.125}
