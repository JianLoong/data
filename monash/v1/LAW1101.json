This introduces the sources of authoritative law - statutes, delegated legislation and judicial precedents.  A substantial portion of the study of the Australian legal system will examine how judges use precedents and interpret legislation. We will use a series of cases from a selected area of law to study how the content of common law changes within the constraints of the doctrine and practice of precedent. Students will assess the influence of social change in the development of the common law.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW1101","eftsl":0.125}
