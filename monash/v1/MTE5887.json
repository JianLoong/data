This unit will provide an overview of existing additive manufacturing processes such as \u0027fused deposition modelling\u0027, \u0027stereolithography\u0027, \u0027polymer jetting\u0027 and \u0027powder bed fusion\u0027. Each of these technologies relies on the appropriate selection of a polymer and the fundamentals of different classes of polymeric materials will be reviewed. Advantages and drawbacks of existing and emerging AM technologies will also be discussed. The unit will also investigate examples of the use of these technologies for the design and fabrication of functional polymeric parts. The students will obtain practical skills in 3D printing of polymers, computer-aided design and processing of polymers for Additive Manufacturing.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE5887","eftsl":0.125}
