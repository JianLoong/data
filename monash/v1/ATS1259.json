Why is sport so important? Why are issues with Indigenous Australia still so unresolved? Why is gender spoken about so often in current Australian media? Why does ANZAC day matter so much?We will investigate contemporary Australian issues through a sociological, political, and historical lens by each week covering a different theme or idea in Australia: Indigenous Australia, the economy, gender, sport, pop culture, multiculturalism, the environment, politics, and more. By asking, \"How is Australia dealing with this?\", \"What happened in Australia\u0027s history for the nation to approach the issue in this way?\", \"What does the way this issue is being thought about tell us about current Australia?\", we will be able to answer the \"whys\": \"Why is Australia like this now?\", \"Why did it do those things in the past?\", \"Why is this issue handled like this now in Australia?\"As well as expert guest speakers coming to address the students on certain topics, there may be an additional optional field trip.","enjoyResponse":101,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1259","eftsl":0.125}
