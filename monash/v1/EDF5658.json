Young people\u0027s learning and social development does not occur in isolation. Young people grow up in families with cultural backgrounds and beliefs, and in communities and/or contexts that are diverse and have varying economic, social and cultural capital. The unit focuses on the competing and overlapping definitions of culture, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and identity. It explores young people\u0027s engagement with popular and traditional culture and the diverse ways in which different groups of young people live, and appropriate and negotiate their cultural expressions and identities. Programs and policies designed to promote social inclusion and equity among young people from diverse backgrounds are also examined.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5658","eftsl":0.25}
