Mathematical concepts are used to describe the fields, and examine the basic laws governing the generation of fields and their interactions with dielectric and magnetic materials. This study results in Maxwell\u0027s field equations, and related Laplace, Poisson and continuity equations. The real life applications of electromagnetic fields in radio communications and devises such as scanners, printers and mass spectrometers are also explored in this unit. Finally, plane wave propagation is analysed briefly as an extension of Maxwell\u0027s field equations.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3121","eftsl":0.125}
