Students are involved in analyses of pedagogical, social, cultural, political and economic dimensions of curriculum theory, practice, design and assessment that meet diverse learners\u0027 needs. They develop in-depth knowledge of the key elements and requirements of current policy relevant to their local, regional and national contexts. They explore exemplars of early years programs and planning and how children\u0027s activities are assessed, so they can competently and professionally develop practices expected in early childhood learning and care nationally and internationally.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2038","eftsl":0.125}
