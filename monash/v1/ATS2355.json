This unit explores white Australia\u0027s attempt to represent Indigenous people, moving beyond the historical, political and legal \u0027facts\u0027 of the colonial encounter to address the inherent theoretical problems of \u0027talking\u0027 about and for Australia\u0027s Indigenous peoples. Topics covered include representation of Indigenous people in media, history, sport, culture, public administration and law. The unit is self reflexive and critically assesses way the Western academy has claimed to possess knowledge about Indigenous people and authority over Indigenous lives.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2355","eftsl":0.125}
