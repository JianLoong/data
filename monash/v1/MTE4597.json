The nanomaterials include zero-dimensional nanoparticles, one-dimensional nanostructures (nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires and nanofibres) and two-dimensional thin films and  nanocomposites. Principles of nanofabrication such as lithography and self-assembly will be introduced. The unit will stress the design of properties and devices based on biomimicry. It will highlight the importance of nanostructured materials in a range of areas such as sensors and energy-related applications.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4597","eftsl":0.125}
