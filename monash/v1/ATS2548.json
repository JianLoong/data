It examines the rise of environmentalism as a broad based movement and how it has led to the framing of environmental problems by policy makers and managers in terms of state regulation, market-based, and citizen participation approaches. Themes include western ideas of property rights, neoliberalism and environmental governance, scientisation of environmental knowledge, Indigenous environmental management, internationalisation of environmental policy and corporate environmentalism.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2548","eftsl":0.125}
