Practical translation skills are introduced with reference to language use common in the Indonesian media. Seminars and tutorials provide language practice through the discussion, debate and communicative tasks that investigate the cultural and political background to both long term and emerging issues in Indonesia. A number of issues in contemporary Indonesia are introduced at this level and then subsequently taken up on an individual and more sophisticated way in later units (e.g. media is introduced here but taken up as an individual focus in ATS3117; politics is introduced here but political culture becomes a focus in ATS3115).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2113","eftsl":0.125}
