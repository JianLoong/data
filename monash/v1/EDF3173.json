The unit forms part of a sequence of health discipline studies that develops students\u0027 disciplinary knowledge required to teach health education. The unit addresses three interrelated interdisciplinary food themes including food production and sustainability; food politics and cultures; and nutrition for health and wellbeing. Throughout the unit, students consider how communities, families and individual food choices are shaped by a myriad of factors including geography, culture, politics, economics, gender, environment, nutrition and taste. Drawing on literature and research studies in this field, students are involved in critical explorations into how public health authorities and policies attempt to govern and regulate food choice and food practices in order to influence health and wellbeing. Students review, analyse, consolidate and synthesise this knowledge to advance their knowledge in this field.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3173","eftsl":0.125}
