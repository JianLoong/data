More sophisticated analytical methods such as root locus and frequency response will be explored and will build the foundation for controller design in the future. Modeling via state-space methods will also be briefly covered.","enjoyResponse":39,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"TRC3600","eftsl":0.125}
