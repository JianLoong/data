This exploration will begin at a personal level and expand to clinical settings with the broader health environment. Varied definitions and models of health will be introduced to allow a detailed exploration of illness, health risks and how individuals, families and communities use limited resources.Differences between health of the individual and the broader population will be examined using the clinical environment as the focal point. The factors that impact the dimensions of health will be critically explored to better understand the roles of government policies, the private sector and communities. Current inequalities in resources and other factors affecting health in clinical settings will be identified.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"IPE1011","eftsl":0.125}
