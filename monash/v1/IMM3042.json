Disorders include autoimmune diseases, allergy, immunodeficiency states, leukaemia/ lymphoma and transplant rejection. Prospects for tumour vaccines will also be discussed. How new insight into the cellular and molecular nature of the immune system is enabling improved diagnosis and more effective control of these disorders will be demonstrated. Skills will also be developed in searching and critically reviewing the literature, in assignment writing and oral presentation.","enjoyResponse":58,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"IMM3042","eftsl":0.125}
