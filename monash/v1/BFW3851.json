This unit will explore the notion that market efficiency assumptions are idealistic by bringing in the concepts of psychology, sociology, and behavioural economics and how the investor mind works in a broader societal setting. This will allow for better understanding of the investor\u0027s mind, resulting in intelligent investment practices. This unit is interdisciplinary, encompassing areas such as financial economics and cognitive sciences with both experimental and theoretical components.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"BFW3851","eftsl":0.125}
