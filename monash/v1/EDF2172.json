They consider the use of fundamental motor skills, teaching games for understanding and game sense approaches to delivery. They examine how these approaches support participant learning and gain an appreciation of how to utilise these different delivery strategies to provide differentiation in their instruction. Students learn how to plan and deliver activities with challenging learning goals in a safe, structured, sequential way. They analyse the use of these activities across a range of contexts including active play, minor games, challenge and adventure, and games and sports. They develop knowledge of how to use technology to undertake performance analysis of both participants and themselves as deliverers. Students are encouraged to critique approaches to delivery using technical, ethical, physiological, social and psychological lenses. The unit develops students\u0027 skills to plan, facilitate and critique a range of movement experiences.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2172","eftsl":0.125}
