The unit develops students\u0027 understanding of the principles and practice of traffic management and the application of advanced technology in transport. The emphasis is on the role of the traffic manager in providing the road and traffic network for road based vehicles along with the planning and design considerations for different road users.  The fundamentals of human factors and road network design are considered. Emphasis is placed on the need to forecast traffic impacts at sites and on the road network. The application of advanced technology to the surface transport system, known as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), is considered in detail.  This unit introduces students to the field of ITS, examines component technologies and explores how those component technologies are brought together in applications or products.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV5318","eftsl":0.25}
