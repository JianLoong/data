Students examine how children express ideas and feelings through drama, music, arts and dance. Students analyse children\u0027s creativity, method of thinking and problem-solving skills. They develop professional skills to plan and implement learning programs that challenge children to expand their reasoning, imagination and understanding of the world, along with encouraging an educational environment that allows children to become more confident of their views and opinions. Students engage in their own arts processes and reflect critically and creatively on these using a range of technologies that extend their knowledge of creative media and techniques appropriate for young children. Practice-led workshops provide opportunities for individual and collaborative projects to illustrate how students engage, guide, scaffold and assess children\u0027s creative expression in an arts-centred curriculum.","enjoyResponse":45,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5023","eftsl":0.125}
