The myths we explore focus on creation stories, tales associated with birth, marriage, and death rites but we also examine the mediums/genres of ancient story-telling such as oral traditions, epic, and drama. In addition, students will be introduced to the theoretical tools associated with the study of ancient mythology and religion including structuralism, post-structuralism, functionalism and phenomenology. The content of the unit will be frequently updated to give the opportunity to all the members of the teaching team to draw on their areas of expertise.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2084","eftsl":0.125}
