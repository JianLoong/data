It uses a curriculum case (for example, the newly released Australian Curriculum) to explore concepts of curriculum and their interplay with both pedagogy and assessment practices. Through this case, students learn how to critique curriculum by exploring its stated purpose, the educational philosophies evident in its scope and focus, and the underlying and implicit cultural norms and values. These insights provide a lens through which to consider the relationship between pedagogy (the implemented curriculum) and the intended curriculum and the way in which assessment is developed and enacted in the light of the educational intentions of the curriculum. The assignments for this unit allow students to explore their own relevant curriculum case and to think critically about the ways in which curriculum, pedagogy and assessment are connected with increased accountability, educational policy and changing political agendas.","enjoyResponse":73,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5621","eftsl":0.25}
