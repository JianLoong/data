Students will travel to the major centres of interwar Jewish life in Italy, Germany, Poland and Lithuania, and encounter the diverse heritage of Jewish life in each country. The unit will explore issues central to this period and the individuals who shaped their times. Students will visit museums, synagogues, cemeteries, destroyed ghettos, and sites of mass murder such as Auschwitz-Birkenau. We will ask what remains of the past, by looking at the ways in which the lost world of European Jews is being memorialised and renewed through tourism and return.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4286","eftsl":0.25}
