Specifically this unit will introduce students to the pharmacological principles of drug action. It includes descriptions of agonist and antagonist activities, analysis of agonist-effect relationships and the intracellular processes by which endogenous and exogenously applied compounds elicit effects. Students will receive a series of lectures covering in-depth aspects of receptor pharmacology.These lectures will also cover in detail the pharmacological regulation of cellular calcium and the role calcium plays in cell function and survival. At the completion of this unit students will have been provided the opportunity to understand drug receptor interactions from the pharmacologists point of view. This unit will equip students for third year Pharmaceutical Biology.","enjoyResponse":43,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC2012","eftsl":0.125}
