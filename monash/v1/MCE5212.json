Students will be taught the theoretical basis of current techniques in genetic diagnosis, polymerase chain  reaction (PCR), fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and micro-array analysis. This knowledge is enhanced with practical training in embryo biopsy and analysis of resultant blastomeres by FISH and PCR techniques. On completion, students will possess a sound theoretical knowledge and understanding of the molecular and genetic techniques used in a clinical human genetics laboratory, and also become familiar with the different practical applications of these techniques.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MCE5212","eftsl":0.125}
