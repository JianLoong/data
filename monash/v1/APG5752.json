Most site visits will be in Melbourne and Sydney, but may also include international travel. Students will draw on background knowledge and skills in analysis gained from other units, gaining the opportunity to test them against real world examples. The unit will have a strong element of experiential learning, through seeing the insides of media organizations and having direct contact with those who work in them. At the same time, it will encourage critical scholarly thinking.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5752","eftsl":0.25}
