Through a variety of media and methodologies, students explore how to make sense of the form and structure of the body, drawing on perceptual, observational and conceptual drawing strategies. Students will work from the life model, marquettes, anatomical specimens and various forms of diagrammatic representation of the body; with increasing specialisation and knowledge, directed towards individual study projects.  Appropriate OHS guidelines and consideration of the ethical requirements of the unit will be addressed.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DWG3516","eftsl":0.125}
