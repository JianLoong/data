The relevance of culture to management practices is analysed and illustrated in various national cultural settings in the Southern African region. The unit then considers contemporary issues that affect the cross-cultural communication process (eg: ethics) before considering the international negotiation process. Objectives, methods of negotiation and ways of negotiating cross-culturally are considered. The unit seeks to impart to students the ability and an awareness of how to communicate effectively in a cross-cultural setting.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGS5640","eftsl":0.125}
