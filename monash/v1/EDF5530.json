Students are introduced to basic and advanced micro-skills, concepts and theories that are currently used in counselling practice, and also examine and apply a range of strategies used by therapists to note, track and evaluate the progress of the client in therapy. The unit provides students with the opportunity to develop and practise their micro-skills and techniques over the semester and learn the underpinnings that inform the dynamics of counselling processes. Throughout the unit students draw on their current or previous clinical professional experience to apply theory to practice and to reflect on their cultural awareness, sensitivities and the ways in which their personal development may influence their counselling practice.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5530","eftsl":0.25}
