It particularly focuses on children\u0027s mathematical development in the early years of school including early number concepts, written and mental computation, estimation, measurement and geometry. Students also explore the importance of translating home and community learning into school-based practice. The teaching of mathematics and numeracy are examined from a number of current theoretical perspectives, and students develop appropriate practices that are in line with local and Australian curriculum support that they can implement in their teaching in schools.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2021","eftsl":0.125}
