This unit will provide methods and frameworks for exploring the unique films and television being produced from Asia, beginning with an outline of national industries and contexts and moving to a discussion of regional and international audiences for Asian film and television. Specific attention will be paid to transnational Chinese cinemas (from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong) - both in their popular and art forms - and to the cinemas of South East Asia. The unit will also consider more recent pan-Asian productions and diasporic cinemas including Asian Australian cinema. An analysis of television dramas and reality TV formats in Asia will allow us to consider changing audience tastes and consumption practices.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3539","eftsl":0.125}
