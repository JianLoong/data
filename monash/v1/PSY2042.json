Personality theories that are covered include: 1) psychodynamic theories of Freud and Jung; 2) phenomenological theories of Kelly and Rogers; 3) Eysenck\u0027s trait approach; 4) Costa and McCrae\u0027s five factor model; and, 5) Bandura\u0027s social learning theory. Social psychology concepts that will be covered include: 1) social cognition and influence; 2) social identity and attribution; 3) group dynamics and intergroup behaviour; 4) attitude and attitude change; and, 5) attraction and aggression. In each case, these theories will be applied and critiqued in light of contemporary evidence.
