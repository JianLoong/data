In this unit, students examine early and recent forms of Indigenous visual traditions (e.g. rock-art, bark paintings, sculpture) to learn about their role and significance in Indigenous societies. Topics to be discussed include art\u0027s relationship to landscapes and seascapes, issues of interpretation, and how art reflects interaction with the \u0027other\u0027. The unit combines anthropological, archaeological, and Indigenous approaches to understanding the production, meaning and symbolism associated with various images and objects created through time.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2019","eftsl":0.125}
