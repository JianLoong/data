The unit covers a range of material concerns: sculptural, painterly, filmic, performative, durational, conceptual and so on. Themes may change in different years, but include such questions as \"What is contemporary art?\", \"How do we define aesthetics after conceptualism?\" and \"How can art be political today?\" The course also covers institutional concerns, such as methods of dissemination, global reach, biennales, gallery contexts and curatorial implications. With help from teaching staff, students are encouraged to focus the assessment tasks on the concerns of their studio practice or art writing and art history interests.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT3105","eftsl":0.125}
