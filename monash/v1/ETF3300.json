It teaches how to model and estimate the single-factor and multiple-factor capital asset pricing models; and conduct diagnostic checks and reliable statistical inferences on various risk-return relationships and financial market hypotheses. It also introduces recent literature on modelling, estimating and forecasting financial markets\u0027 volatility; and parametric and nonparametric methods to estimate the value at risk and expected shortfall.
