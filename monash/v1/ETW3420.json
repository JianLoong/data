This challenge is exacerbated against the backdrop of structural changes and volatility in markets and the economy. In this unit, students will be introduced to methods suitable for forecasting in these circumstances. These methods include classical decomposition of time series, exponential smoothing, Box-Jenkins ARIMA modelling and regression with auto-correlated disturbances. Students will also be exposed to several case studies, to study the application of these methods in real-life situations. Students can expect to enhance their computer skills with exercises using econometric packages.","enjoyResponse":23,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETW3420","eftsl":0.125}
