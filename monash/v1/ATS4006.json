It is both a theory and a method and the unit introduces students to both of these dimensions. The theoretical aspect offers students a way of thinking about how religion, power and politics are intertwined through reading and discussion of various texts by modern philosophers, such as Carl Schmitt, Ernest Bloch, Claude Lefort and others. The other aspect offers students a way of using political theology as a method for reading variety of texts in order to uncover forgotten or repressed religious influences in modern secular discourses.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4006","eftsl":0.25}
