Prospective primary school teachers may not have had positive experiences of mathematics and may not be confident of their mathematics. Therefore, the unit challenges students in a supportive environment through \u0027low threshold\u0027 activities designed to promote understanding of mathematical concepts and processes (proficiencies), and build confidence so that students see themselves as mathematically able learners and teachers. The chosen activities have \u0027high ceilings\u0027 that allow the more mathematically confident students to stretch their thinking. Mathematics has its own value and beauty and this unit aims to develop an appreciation of the elegance and power of mathematical reasoning.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1161","eftsl":0.125}
