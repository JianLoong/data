It covers current and future energy scenarios for the world and Australia. This requires an understanding of the basic concepts and modelling of electrical power systems, including techniques for power flow and fault analysis, control of voltage, frequency, harmonic distortion, and system stability. Methods are presented to identify and clear faults, maximise power system economy and estimate the capital cost as well as unit price of electricity ($/kWh) using various energy conversion technologies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4053","eftsl":0.125}
