It will build on a model of paramedic clinical competence developed in prerequisite units and will provide the context to support the implementation of knowledge and skills necessary for effective patient care. Students will have the opportunity to practice and develop their clinical skills in the management of patients with acute health conditions through clinical placements with ambulance service providers and other health agencies.
