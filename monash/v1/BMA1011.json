Students will be introduced to the principles of cell biology, tissue types and their origins together with their importance in maintaining the homeostasis of the various body systems. The key anatomical features of the integumentary and musculoskeletal systems will be examined as well as their role in the control of homeostasis. The central and peripheral nervous system will be addressed in the context of its physiological characteristics and with special attention to the anatomical features of the spinal cord and brain. Students will be introduced to the various functions of the brain in the context of homeostasis and control, together with the special senses. Throughout the unit, clinical connections will be made with the systems addressed so that students will understand the relevance of the topics included in the unit to the health and human science disciplines.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BMA1011","eftsl":0.125}
