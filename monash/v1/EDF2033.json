The theoretical and practical context of how children learn from birth to eight years of age is explored to support students\u0027 capacity for building effective relationships. The focus is on the implications of development for learning and teaching in relation to contemporary issues impacting on children\u0027s learning with their family and communities. All aspects of learning and teaching in these early years is examined through participation in problem-based learning scenarios and observed case studies where students analyse and apply knowledge of children, family and communities. Students learn to understand how theoretical and contemporary real-life issues relate to the development of children\u0027s learning, and they develop their ability to design innovative learning with children, their families and communities.","enjoyResponse":48,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2033","eftsl":0.125}
