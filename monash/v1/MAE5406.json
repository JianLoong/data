In particular, the finite-volume and finite-difference methods will be explored, as well as approaches to solve both time-dependent and steady state problems. The project work will mainly focus on using commercial computational fluid dynamics software to model relevant flows, and relating the results back to the theoretical work. Both incompressible and compressible flows will be considered. Some project work will examine modeling flows past airfoils, and another aerospace application.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5406","eftsl":0.125}
