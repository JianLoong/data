Held in the winter semester as a two-week intensive, students will spend a week in Johannesburg and a week in Rwanda exploring public debates on memory and justice through visits to memorial sites and museums. Places to be explored include Soweto, the Apartheid Museum, Constitution Hill, the Murambi genocide memorial, and a Gacaca village trial.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG4314","eftsl":0.25}
