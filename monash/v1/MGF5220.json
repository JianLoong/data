It seeks to identify linkages between individuals, families, work environments, and society by studying the research that explores this interdependence. Implications of a number of radical changes (eg: increasing demographic and cultural diversity, greater emphasis on lifestyle balance by employed men and women, and changes in the way work is structured) on these linkages will be examined. Topics studied include work-family conflict, organisational work-life policies and programs, legal and business issues concerning work-life.","enjoyResponse":27,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGF5220","eftsl":0.125}
