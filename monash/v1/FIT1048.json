The unit provides a foundational understanding of program design and implementation of algorithms to solve simple problems. Fundamental programming control structures, built in and complex data-types and mechanisms for modularity will be presented in C++. This unit also places a focus on object-oriented design principles, using object-oriented design as a process for program design and problem solving. More advanced object-oriented programming topics such as inheritance and polymorphism will also be covered. Other C++ fundamentals such as pointers and the STL will be presented, as will implementations of algorithms and data structures used in problem solving.","enjoyResponse":100,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT1048","eftsl":0.125}
