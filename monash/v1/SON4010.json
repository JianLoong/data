The second major component addresses the gross, regional and sectional anatomy of the thyroid, abdomen and pelvis, the vascular, musculoskeletal, hepatobiliary and genitourinary systems along with examples of pathophysiology relevant to medical ultrasound. A key component throughout this unit is the development of image evaluation skills in relation to the cross-sectional, coronal and sagittal display of these structures and their surrounding regional anatomy.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"SON4010","eftsl":0.125}
