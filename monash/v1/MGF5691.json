By combining recent theory and practical examples, this unit provides students with tools that allow companies to reduce their overall resource use, manage their social and environmental risks at the extended enterprise level and design products and processes toward sustainable resource use. Specific topics include management systems for risk reduction and compliance, sustainable transport and distribution, closed-loop issues, mid-tier value chains, extended enterprise issues (e.g. certification and monitoring of suppliers), supplier development, technology protection and ethics. Topics are addressed from predominantly design and behavioural perspectives.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGF5691","eftsl":0.125}
