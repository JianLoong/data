It will investigate the engineering and science of unit operations involved in the production of paper from fibres; refining of chemical pulps; the paper machine approach systems; headbox design and performance; dewatering and network formation in the forming section; wet-end additives and wet-end systems; water removal and web modification in the press and dryer sections; property enhancement by calendering and by the addition of material at the size press and coater; and winding and finishing operations. It will examine the equipment used for each operation, the functioning of this equipment and the impact of each operation on the properties of the paper or board being produced.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE5293","eftsl":0.125}
