The unit emphasises contemporary theory and thinking on community development, coupled with an orientation to professional practice in real contexts, both internationally and locally. The impacts of globalisation are examined, both in terms of its negative consequences, but also in terms of creating new possibilities for activism and solidarity. The unit also focuses on the skills and methods of community development facilitators, and fosters and develops those skills in students through group activities such as simulations, role-plays, case studies and fieldtrips.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5372","eftsl":0.125}
