Students also spend time at Monash Malaysia Sunway campus at the start and end of the field trip, with briefings and introductory presentations by academic staff, and data analysis and debriefing workshops at the end. In this briefing, students also learn about the socioeconomic and development context of Malaysia and the districts in which they will conduct their research.
