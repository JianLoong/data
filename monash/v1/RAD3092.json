The unit covers the basic physics of magnetic dipoles and magnetic spin resonance, through to a detailed presentation of the basic gradient and spin echo sequences that are used in medical MRI scanners. The factors that determine the contrast and spatial resolution achievable in MRI are discussed. The FID signal sampling and image reconstruction methods are reviewed, as are the SNR and image artifacts that typically occur in MRI. Patient and MRI staff safety issues are presented. An overview of MRI imaging applications, such as spectroscopic and dynamic imaging is presented.","enjoyResponse":23,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD3092","eftsl":0.125}
