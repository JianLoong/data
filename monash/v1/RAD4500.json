It extends knowledge of the basic physical principles of multislice computed tomography (CT) and the protocols and processing methods used to image the whole body. The physical principles underpinning 3-D volumetric imaging will be contextualised within the axial, SSH and MSH scanning modes/systems. The techniques for processing and visualising 3-D images will be critically analysed. The unit will describe the physical and mathematical principles related to multi-planar reformats, maximum intensity projection, slab maximum intensity projection, surface rendering or shaded surface display and volume rendering. Protocols, patient preparation and monitoring, positioning, post-processing techniques and dose optimisation related to CT biopsies, interventional CT, virtual endoscopy, and CT angiography will be described and evaluated from within an evidence-based framework. The unit will conclude with an introduction to image interpretation of the brain and CTPA and the application of quality assurance and quality control principles to multislice CT imaging.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD4500","eftsl":0.125}
