The crystal structures of the different materials and their properties will be correlated. Examples include cutting tools, wear parts and advanced refractories. The second part of the unit will introduce functional ceramics, predominantly those used in electrical or electronic applications, their microstructure and nanostructure. Examples include thermistors, varistors, capacitors, multi-layer substrates, piezoelectric and electrooptic transducers, and gas sensors.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4592","eftsl":0.125}
