Students will be introduced to the interdisciplinary nature of physical computing with an emphasis on tangibility, and focus on design implementation using an integrated prototyping skill-set. Students will develop a repertoire of knowledge through the exploration of the concepts, methodology and vocabulary of physical computing enabled prototyping techniques. Skills developed in this unit will be used to support the major studio project to bring abstract concepts into the real world.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC4216","eftsl":0.125}
