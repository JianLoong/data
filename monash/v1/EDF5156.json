It extends students\u0027 knowledge, understandings and skills in languages education. Students draw on research literature to develop an understanding of learning strategies in order to build effective practices to inform their teaching in second language competencies. This unit critically examines a range of contemporary curriculum and pedagogical innovations in languages education, including the use of information and communication technology (ICT), second language literacies, critical inquiry and action research projects. Through further examination of a range of national and international languages and education policies, students investigate and evaluate theoretical and practical links between disciplines, domains and literacies in order to better appreciate the importance of communication and how languages contribute to this educative process. Working collaboratively and independently, students consolidate their content knowledge, develop pedagogical knowledge and skills enabling them to provide solutions to complex educational challenges in secondary schools.","enjoyResponse":23,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5156","eftsl":0.125}
