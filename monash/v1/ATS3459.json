In particular students examine the differential experiences associated with early punishments and imprisonment on socially disadvantaged groups according to gender, race, class and ability. This subject also examines contemporary and comparative issues about the prison and its social impacts. A central theme subject is to understand the contemporary revalorization of the prison in contemporary times as the key solution for managing social problems associated with the rise of neo-liberal capitalism and its associated injustices. Key themes include punishment and social control, institutional cultures of violence, the politics of imprisonment and penal reform and the future of imprisonment more broadly.","enjoyResponse":59,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3459","eftsl":0.125}
