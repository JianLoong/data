Based on psychological and criminological theory of such behaviours a framework is presented, then applied to each specific behaviour. The role of mental disorder in the genesis of such behaviours is considered, in addition to the multiple psychological and social factors involved. Students will gain a theoretical understanding and develop a pragmatic model for working with a broad range of perpetrators in an ethical and evidence-based fashion.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"FBS5005","eftsl":0.125}
