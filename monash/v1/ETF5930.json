It includes modelling, estimating and analysing time series properties of stationary and non-stationary financial data: and modelling and estimating simple and multivariate long-run relationships among financial variables; and conducting Granger causality testing. It also includes modelling and estimation of ARCH/GARCH volatilities and time-varying risk premium on financial assets; and estimation of value-at-risks and expected shortfalls of assets and portfolios. Students will be requested to work through a number of questions and projects with a broad range of financial data sets.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETF5930","eftsl":0.125}
