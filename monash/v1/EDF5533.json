Students examine applied and academic research and evaluation in relation to mental health issues and counselling, and evaluate the quality of, and approaches used to gather, research evidence. Reflecting and drawing on their current or previous clinical professional experience, students consolidate their skills in case formulation, documenting evidence-based interventions and choosing appropriate assessment tools and instruments. Under supervision, students take up opportunities for self-reflection on their own professional development as counsellors.","enjoyResponse":30,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5533","eftsl":0.25}
