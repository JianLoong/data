The properties of pure substances, steam tables and phase diagrams and their use in thermodynamics problems, First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics and their use in steady and unsteady state problems, Carnot cycle, Gas power cycles, vapour and combined power cycles are introduced. Use of T-s diagrams for power cycle analysis, P-h diagrams in refrigeration cycle analysis and simple combustion processes are covered. Renewable energy such as solar, hydro, wind and biomass, and their use in heating and electricity generation and the environmental benefits of renewable energy conclude study in this unit.","enjoyResponse":87,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC2405","eftsl":0.125}
