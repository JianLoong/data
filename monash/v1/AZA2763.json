The early identification of symptoms of a disorder facilitates early treatment and accurate referral, increasing the chances of a successful outcome for the child.  Since childcare workers spend a large quantity of hours with children they are in the ideal position to not only identify problems early through risk factors and symptoms, but also with highlighting the protective or resiliency factors that will assist the child in overcoming challenges successfully.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA2763","eftsl":0.125}
