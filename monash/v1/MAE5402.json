Additionally the particular forms of loading encountered in airframes and associated components on the structural response and interactions between load-bearing members is considered in detail, leading to a firm understanding of structural aspects of airframes. This complements the co-requisite unit MAE5403 Composite airframes, thereby allowing a mature understanding of the potential synergy between structural forms and materials of construction.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5402","eftsl":0.125}
