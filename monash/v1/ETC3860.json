A complex systems science perspective will be adopted, introducing Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) as a flexible and powerful tool for exploring solutions to complex real-world problems. The ABM approach will be demonstrated and critically assessed through several interdisciplinary, integrated economy/sustainability models. Additionally, a flexible ABM modelling platform (NetLogo) will be introduced and demonstrated.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETC3860","eftsl":0.125}
