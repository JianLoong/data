Projects are generally software-based, although sometimes they may involve hardware development or investigation of theory. Projects cover the whole process of software (or hardware) development, from analysis through design to implementation and testing. Comprehensive written documentation on the project is required. Students are assigned in groups to a project supervisor. There are no lectures in this unit, although students will be expected to attend regular meetings with their project supervisor. The application problem will normally be drawn from the student\u0027s field of specialisation.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3144","eftsl":0.25}
