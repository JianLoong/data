The unit will move from discussion of the American influence to the \u0027pluralism\u0027 of the 1970s: minimal art, performance art and feminism. The focus from the 1980s to the present will address some of the following: neo-expressionism, appropriation, nomadology, aboriginality, post-feminism, developments in abstraction, installation, queer art, the body, relational and dialogical aesthetics. Contemporary theory will be addressed throughout.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT4076","eftsl":0.25}
