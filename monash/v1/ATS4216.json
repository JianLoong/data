We will explore a number of approaches to the past which look below and above the level of the nation. These may include comparative and transnational history, global history, borderlands studies, migration studies, the history of tourism and travel and Atlantic history. The unit aims to introduce students to the dramatic impact of such approaches in opening up new areas of historical investigation as well as revising existing interpretations of the past in a range of fields. We will also examine the methodological and practical challenges faced by historians who look beyond the framework of the nation, from periodization to use of sources to publication.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4216","eftsl":0.25}
