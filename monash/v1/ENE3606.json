The unit focusses on air pollution sources, emissions behaviour, pollutant pathways, receptor impacts and the associated national legislation and international treaties. The unit includes atmospheric stability conditions, pollutant transport models, air pollution control strategies and factors important in control equipment or schemes. The unit also encompasses climate change, greenhouse gas emissions sources and carbon accounting as well as national and international climate change mitigation strategies and adaptation approaches.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENE3606","eftsl":0.125}
