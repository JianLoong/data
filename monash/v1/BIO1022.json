The biology of microbes and animals is emphasised. Ecological factors that are biologically important at the level of integrated whole organisms and at cellular, subcellular, and biochemical levels are considered for each organism under study. As for BIO1011 the unit is structured to encourage self paced learning with considerable feed back on individual performance.","enjoyResponse":408,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO1022","eftsl":0.125}
