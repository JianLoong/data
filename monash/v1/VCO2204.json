While continuing to develop individual illustration skills, students will be expected to realise their images in their intended contexts, such as packaging design, shopping bags, book covers, posters, advertisements, or other traditional graphic design formats. While being exposed to traditional image making processes students will also be encouraged to explore more experimental methods. A mix of hand generated imagery and digital methods will be encouraged.","enjoyResponse":22,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VCO2204","eftsl":0.125}
