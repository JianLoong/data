The focus is broadly on the period from 1185 to 1867 when Japan was ruled by a succession of warrior regimes but the unit will also explore the evolution of samurai images and representations primarily in film but also in books, anime, manga, and video games. The central concern is with the evolution of the figure of the samurai across this long period and with the constant tensions between the ideals put forward about the way of the warrior and the actual realities of samurai life.  We will explore the samurai from varied perspectives by considering questions of status, identity, politics, gender, and economics.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2620","eftsl":0.125}
