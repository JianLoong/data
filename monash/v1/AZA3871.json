This has led to calls for a completely new ethic based on environmental values and a non-anthropocentric world view.  The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. We examine issues such as: animal rights, the intrinsic value of nature and eco-centric notions of value. Various ethical dilemmas which arise in relation to our treatment of animals and the environment, the value of wilderness, population growth and the ethical responsibilities that come with globalization will be discussed. These issues are linked to the situation regarding the environment in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the problems encountered within this context.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3871","eftsl":0.125}
