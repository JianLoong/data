We will first consider the relevant historical context, and the biography of the authors and whether or not they experienced the events directly, before discussing how the topic of war becomes a means to present larger issues such as the nature of what an enemy is, how terror is understood, the role of heroism, and what it means to be a victor. We will also examine how war writing discusses aspects such as gender, and how the literature is in sync with larger socio-historical trends.  We will also analyse if and how the literature of war and loss is artistic.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3955","eftsl":0.125}
