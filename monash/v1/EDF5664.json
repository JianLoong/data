Students explore how socially inclusive communities are developed before considering the place of community-located education as a means to promote inclusion. Students learn how and why experiential learning and transformative approaches to teaching and learning can be used in community contexts to address core social issues such as poverty, racism, crime and ill health. Practical case studies are examined and developed to explore the role of education in promoting community inclusion in global settings.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5664","eftsl":0.25}
