The papacy has been central to the development of the modern world. A powerful and often seemingly mysterious institution, it lies at the heart of European culture and the broader Catholic world. This unit explores the nature and role of the papacy in relation to changing political, social, intellectual and cultural circumstances of the medieval and early modern periods. Topics include: understandings of papal polity, religious reform and revolt, the impact of humanism, cultural encounters and exchanges, Catholicism and modernity, the papacy on the world stage, as well as expressions of power in papal Rome.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3288","eftsl":0.125}
