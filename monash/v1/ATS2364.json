The first section of the Unit examines these themes from a historical perspective, exploring issues such as protectionism, the 1938 Day of Mourning, assimilation, the 1967 Referendum, self-determination and the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. The second section of the Unit discusses several contemporary Indigenous issues that relate to the two themes. These issues include: land rights, native title, deaths in custody, the stolen generation, reconciliation, treaty, welfare reform and sovereignty.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2364","eftsl":0.125}
