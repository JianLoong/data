It draws upon ideas and practices associated with crafts and craft knowledge and skill in ways that provide a basis for teachers to work with students to build and extend student engagements in school learning. Schooling experiences often involve making things, putting things together, organising ideas and developing capabilities to support student thinking and taking decisive action. Students as pre-service teachers are provided with the knowledge and capacities to understand and implement practical education and learning experiences to secondary students. The unit is organised around the three core threshold concepts of making as thinking, doing as learning and knowing through practice.","enjoyResponse":24,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4264","eftsl":0.125}
