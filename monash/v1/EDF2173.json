Students critically explore the place of health in people\u0027s lives and consider a range of factors that shape individual and population health. They also develop knowledge of priority health issues, determinants of health and an appreciation for ways of working to promote health and wellbeing. By developing health promotion planning and evaluation skills, students carefully consider health promotion as a key field for addressing, managing and having an impact upon individual and population health. Areas of investigation and important dimensions of practice include settings-based approaches, partnership, participation, multi-level action, capacity building and evidence-based practice, policy development for health, creating supportive environments, and health education strategies. The application of these to youth health challenges in diverse cultural and economic contexts is also explored.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2173","eftsl":0.125}
