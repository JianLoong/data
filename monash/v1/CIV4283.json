The concept of sustainable transport is introduced along with the steps in the transport planning process. Emphasis is placed on the interrelationship between transport and land use planning and on the range of supply and demand oriented approaches that can be used to enhance the sustainability of urban transport systems. Strategic transport network models are introduced with consideration given to the calibration and application of those models. Travel survey methods are considered and the relationship between survey design, survey administration and data quality is explored.","enjoyResponse":32,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV4283","eftsl":0.125}
