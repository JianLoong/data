This unit introduces students to the fundamental principles, technologies and systems that define avionics technology. It provides a coherent and unified framework to model and analyse the elements of avionics systems. The focus is on the physical phenomena and analytical procedures required to understand avionics sub-systems and their integration. The unit will guide students towards an application of how fundamental techniques of electronics, communications, information and control theory are applied to modern avionics systems.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5405","eftsl":0.125}
