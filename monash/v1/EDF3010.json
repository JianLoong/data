Through an examination of a range of innovative practices that engage diverse student populations, the unit explores the ways in which teachers in schools transform centralised curriculum documents and bring curriculum \u0027to life\u0027. In association with this exploration, students investigate a range of issues that include maximising learner motivation in schools, engagement through curriculum development and innovative practice, developing community-based curriculas and practices, and teachers seeing themselves as \u0027curriculum workers\u0027 and the implication of this for their professional identity. Students draw on their emerging understandings of curriculum policies, issues and innovation to develop practices that are inclusive, exciting and educational.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3010","eftsl":0.125}
