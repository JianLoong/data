Students will be introduced to the basic principles of neuroscience, including neuron structure and function, neurotransmission, and functional neuroanatomy. These will be examined within the broader framework of functional systems (e.g. sensation, perception, and memory), and will be used to facilitate an understanding of the neurobiological basis of psychological function and dysfunction. The integration of a quantitative methods module into this unit will provide students with an understanding of, and practical experience with, the application of statistical analysis techniques used to address research questions in Biological Psychology.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY2061","eftsl":0.125}
