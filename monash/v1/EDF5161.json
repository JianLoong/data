The units introduce students to the language, methods and major ideas useful in mathematics teaching, and focus on content, pedagogy and the interrelationships between them. Students are provided with opportunities to develop their subject matter, knowledge and skills relevant to teaching in secondary schools and refine their attitudes through reflecting on new and past experiences. The units prepare students to teach mathematics and consider the philosophy and evidence-based research that underpins their teaching. Students are encouraged to develop an understanding of the subject discipline\u0027s place within secondary schools, at both junior level (Years 7 to 10) in this unit and senior levels (Years 11 to 12) in EDF5162. Together, the units emphasise a view of learning about teaching as an ongoing, collaborative inquiry that is developed through critical reflection and research on experience.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5161","eftsl":0.125}
