This unit will introduce fundamental techniques for studying linear systems and ordinary differential equations, focusing on applications to physical systems. The topics in linear algebra to be considered include: eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalisation of square matrices, matrix functions, LU-decomposition, applications. The topics in optimisation include: Lagrange multipliers, the method of least-squares, linear programming, applications. Finally, the topics in ordinary differential equations include: advanced Laplace transforms, Fourier transforms, matrix solutions of constant coefficient systems, conservative systems, phase-planes of simple non-linear ODEs, applications. Students will be introduced to the Mathematica computer package, and learn how to use it for analytic and numerical calculations and graphics. It will be integrated into most activities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MTH2040","eftsl":0.125}
