While students are encouraged to look at every problem from several views (informal, algebraic, geometric, etc.), a large emphasis is placed on constructing formal arguments, and the importance of clear notation, definitions, assumptions and deductive arguments is emphasised. Formal lectures and references to graduate level textbooks are provided, and students are also assigned and encouraged to read some classic journal articles. This unit is designed for PhD students who intend to write a thesis in econometrics or business statistics. It is not intended for PhD students in other disciplines who need to learn some quantitative techniques for the empirical section of their dissertations, although students from other departments who are interested in more advanced methods may wish to take this unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ETX6510","eftsl":0.125}
