Conceptual design work, also referred to as concept art, is an essential part of the industrial designer\u0027s repertoire in conceiving of objects which do not yet exist. This core skill has since the 1980s expanded to become a possible end in itself, with designers finding employment and careers in the design of conceptual objects never meant for manufacture, but instead for film, gaming, illustration, science fiction, and other multimedia fields. Centred on drawing, students will be taught a range of skills to capture conceptual designs by the visual description of three dimensional form, and communicate them, with a focus on the designs being plausible in detail but conceptual in nature.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDN2101","eftsl":0.125}
