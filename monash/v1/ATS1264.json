Examples of possible topics covered include: whether employers and insurance companies should be permitted to discriminate among applicants on the basis of genetic profile; whether it is discriminatory to select against sex or disability in future children; whether the law should protect individuals\u0027 genetic privacy or whether we have a duty to share our genetic knowledge; whether the law should act paternalistically to prevent people from harming themselves or making bad health decisions; whether people who are responsible for their own bad health should receive lower medical priority, and whether advances in knowledge in the biological/genetic bases for behaviour give us reason to doubt individual responsibility.","enjoyResponse":61,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1264","eftsl":0.125}
