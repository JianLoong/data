There is an emphasison how the major physiological systems of the body respond to physical activity, including the cardio-respiratory, endocrine and renal systems. The unit details the current research ideas on normal function and dysfunction in this area and discusses new research and clinical methodologies that relate to exercise. We also discuss many of the current issues associated with athletic performance including chemical and physiological doping and the decline with aging. The learning emphasis is on assisted self directed learning and project or collaborative based learning asmodern science is increasingly a multidisciplinary endeavour that is conducted in a team environment.","enjoyResponse":74,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHY3072","eftsl":0.125}
