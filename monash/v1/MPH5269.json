Health professional leaders and managers, and those who aspire to these roles, need to know about these policies and about the process of policy making so that they can understand why a policy is what it is, and how to engage in the policy making process.This unit involves a structured review of policy making processes, via WebCT based modules, readings and online tasks, supplemented by workshops with senior health policy practitioners. It considers key challenges and major issues confronting governments and health systems around the world, and how policy can help address these. The unit presents foundation concepts in health policy, which can be extended with further study of health care delivery policies (MPH5272) and/or global health and primary prevention policies (MPH5260).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MPH5269","eftsl":0.125}
