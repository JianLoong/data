Using their chosen disciplinary field(s) as context, students are supported in developing an understanding of how a range of pedagogical approaches need to be considered in relation to individual student needs and the requirements of senior secondary curriculum and assessment frameworks. In particular, this unit offers students opportunities to further develop pedagogical content knowledge relevant to their chosen disciplinary field(s) and examine engaging and innovative approaches to teaching and learning within the constraints of externally moderated senior secondary curriculum. They are required to draw upon both their classroom experiences and the research literature as they reflect on the critical construction and utilisation of relevant pedagogical content knowledge in the senior years of secondary schooling.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4269","eftsl":0.125}
