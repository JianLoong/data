It involves the design of a self-directed project focusing on an issue or challenge encountered in the course of leadership. The challenge becomes the basis of the design of a small-scale inquiry. Students learn how to set out the key features of a project, and how to select appropriate criteria for evaluating the quality of their research design. The project articulates a research question that responds to the challenge. Students gather and evaluate existing research data. The project describes and assesses the data, and extrapolates meaning from the data to identify a set of findings and actions in relation to the challenge. In doing this, students are conscious of who they are as researchers and leaders in the meaning-making process, how they influence it and the rigor of their conclusions.","enjoyResponse":11,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5671","eftsl":0.25}
