However, its content and learning outcomes are relevant to all courses and careers.Topics covered include verbal and nonverbal communication, the influence of different personal and socio-environmental factors on Communication, gender and cultural differences in communication, and specific communication skills such as effective listening and conflict management.Students will be exposed to both a macro-approach where communication is placed in wider social contexts and central theories are explored, and a micro-approach where practical skills are taught. In their lectures and tutorials, students will have opportunities to measure, reflect on and improve their own communication skills. This will develop their ability to manage their personal and professional relationships with greater sensitivity and skill.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA1433","eftsl":0.125}
