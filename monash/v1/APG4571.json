Students engage with, and critically reflect on the ideas and processes through which social, economic, political and juridical forces structure, define and legitimise the human services industry and human service organisations. Using case study and problem-based learning approaches, students examine the role, function, formation and resourcing of the human service organisation in rural, urban, regional and global contexts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG4571","eftsl":0.25}
