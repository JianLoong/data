They investigate contemporary approaches on how play is defined and re-theorised. Play has been traditionally viewed as an important pedagogical approach in most communities drawing on a European heritage. However, this unit examines how play is culturally constructed in diverse communities and the ways children in contemporary society play and live in their communities. Students undertake analysis of the contemporary theories of play, noting the research upon which particular theories are based. They consider cross-cultural variations, collective relationships, digital spaces and the range of play contexts in which children find themselves today. Students are supported in their work through observing children at play and applying these ideas in their work with children.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5024","eftsl":0.125}
