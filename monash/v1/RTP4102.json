The unit is designed to build on the undergraduate knowledge of psychology and reflective practice. This unit will consist of two key themes, psychological responses to cancer diagnosis and treatment and reflective practice. In Theme 1 students will gain in-depth knowledge on the psychological theories relating to responses to cancer diagnosis, the effects of treatment, grief and death and dying. Students will be able to analyse and describe the cause, nature, presentation and course of psychological responses in people with cancer. Coping mechanisms will be evaluated for cancer patients along the life continuum. In Theme 2, the principles of reflective practice and how these are applied to radiation therapy practice will be studied. In addition, students will also evaluate the role of professional portfolios in documenting reflections and their value to evidencing continuing professional development.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RTP4102","eftsl":0.125}
