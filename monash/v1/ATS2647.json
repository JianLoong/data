Drawing on historical and contemporary scholarship, students will examine three key themes: the reporting of war, trauma and crime. It canvases key theoretical concepts and the ethical considerations related to media power, \u0027othering\u0027, compassion fatigue, violence, exploitation and voyeurism. What are the responsibilities of the press and how does journalism impact on the practitioners, survivors and audience? How do journalists write and represent suffering? Students will engage with seminal case studies, archives, photographs and reportage, as well as discussing texts including works by Vasily Grossman, Truman Capote, Janet Malcolm, Susan Sontag, Susie Linfield, Robert Capa, Marcel Ophuls, Claud Lanzmann, Seymour Hersh, Edward R Murrow and Dorothea Lange. This subject requires a strong interest in news and current affairs along with a thoughtful and flexible approach to some of the key issues raised by the media coverage of trauma.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2647","eftsl":0.125}
