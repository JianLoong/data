But just a century ago the story would have been very different. So what happened between our great grandparents\u0027 generation and ours to revolutionise the way we think about truth and meaning? This is the question that sparks our journey through French culture in this unit. With concrete examples and clear case-studies we will walk in the shoes of film-makers, writers, artists and thinkers as they wrestle with questions of truth and meaning in the rapidly changing twentieth century world, questions that have all-too immediate implications: How should I live my life in a world without certainties? What, if anything, gives my life meaning? And what is left worth fighting for, living for, dying for?","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3077","eftsl":0.125}
