This unit looks at the extent to which Australia is complying with its international obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It does this through analysing domestic laws, policies and practices relating to children\u0027s rights at both a state and federal level. Specific issues are analysed including, children in family law, children in juvenile justice, children in child protection and Indigenous children. We consider the ongoing challenges to the full realisation of children\u0027s rights in Australia, and what reforms might overcome these challenges.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5416","eftsl":0.125}
