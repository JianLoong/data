Its primary focus will be on the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which has established the most sophisticated and successful regional system of human rights protection in the world. The European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, holds to account member states for violations of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the convention to over 800 million persons. The second component concentrates on the European Union and how on the basis of a few EU Treaty provisions - now reinforced by the Charter of Fundamental Rights - the Court of justice has fashioned a comprehensive and dynamic system of judicial protection.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5619","eftsl":0.125}
