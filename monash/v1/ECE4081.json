This includes application of electrochemistry to biological membranes, application of cable theory to nerve axons, application of electronic design principles to the recording of biological electrical signals, application of quantitative optics to spectrometry and fluoroscopy. In addition, the operating principles of a wide range of medical and laboratory instruments will be explored, ranging from pH meters to gene sequencers, pressure transducers to anaesthetic machines.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4081","eftsl":0.125}
