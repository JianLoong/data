This unit will explore the ideal of freedom of expression, and the principles governments use to limit this freedom. The first part of the unit covers the reasons why we think freedom of expression is important, and the strength of the arguments used to justify it. The second part of the unit applies these ideas to contemporary moral and political debates, such as whistleblowing and leaking, privacy and defamation, hate speech, pornography, computer games, classification laws, and anti-terrorism legislation.","enjoyResponse":88,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3445","eftsl":0.125}
