Learning and the different kinds of learning will be covered and their usage will be discussed. The unit presents foundational concepts in machine learning and statistical learning theory, e.g. bias-variance, model selection, and how model complexity interplays with model\u0027s performance on unobserved data. A series of different models and algorithms will be presented and interpreted based on the foundational concepts: linear models for regression and classification (e.g. linear basis function models, logistic regression, Bayesian classifiers, generalised linear models), discriminative and generative models, k-means and latent variable models (e.g. Gaussian mixture model), expectation-maximisation, neural networks and deep learning, and principles in scaling typical supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to big data using distributed computing.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5201","eftsl":0.125}
