The key areas of modelling, rendering and animation will be examined, and various modes of output demonstrated. Different applications of CGI (computer generated imagery), such as motion graphics, character animation and virtual environments are discussed. 3D models will be used to generate movement which involves understanding key sequences, framing and inbetweening.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DIS5201","eftsl":0.125}
