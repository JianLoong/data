Analyses refer to the bio- and psychosocial aetiology of criminal behaviour, classification systems, intervention measures and crime reduction. Attention is paid to life-span development, behavioural disorders, learning and situational risk factors. The relationship between crime and mental disorders are explored, focusing on mentally disordered defendants and offenders, criminal responsibility and risk assessments. The course concludes with psychosocial analyses of specific types of criminal behaviour, for instance, serial murder, pyromania, hostage-taking, domestic violence, sexual offences, substance abuse, and witch-purging.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3463","eftsl":0.125}
