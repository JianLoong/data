It will introduce the concepts of energy balance and body composition and outline the process of digestion. It will describe the role and function of macro and micronutrients essential for human health, their history of discovery, and relevance for the health of populations and individuals. The dietary recommendations for optimal nutrition for the Australian population will be compared with recommendations in other countries. The unit will include the clinical signs and symptoms of specific nutrient deficiency and excess, as well as nutrient interactions and their significance. Methods of nutrition assessment will be explored focussing on methods used to assess food intake, data analysis using qualitative and quantitative methods; and comparison of this data to recommended dietary intakes for optimal health.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"NUT1010","eftsl":0.125}
