It will introduce them to new approaches to image making that do not rely on literal or obvious visual reference. The art of humour, wit, metaphor and abstraction will be utilised in the answering of each brief in order to strengthen the students\u0027 illustration and intellectual skills and consequently their confidence as strong conceptual visual communicators. They will be encouraged toward experimentation and exploration of both traditional and digital illustrative techniques.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VCO3206","eftsl":0.125}
