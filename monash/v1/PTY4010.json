It also introduces quality assessment and critical appraisal of research reports included in the review. In doing this it serves the important role of enabling learning about best practice in research design, and the relationship between research design and the trustworthiness of research conclusions. As part of this unit, students also complete on-line modules that introduce basic concepts in data reporting and analysis. Students have the option to select modules that address the type of data analysis most frequently encountered in the literature they are reviewing. Students are also supported with individualized supervision to tailor reviews to the planned research undertaken as part of \"Honours Research Proposal PTY4020\". Reviews are prepared using a structure that facilitates publication of the work.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PTY4010","eftsl":0.25}
