In this unit, students learn essential skills for managing software development efforts and for working within coordinated teams. Students will learn how to decide upon and document their team\u0027s structure and their process model. They will be expected to follow the process model they have documented, and to evaluate its effectiveness.There are many factors that can potentially cause a software project to fail.
