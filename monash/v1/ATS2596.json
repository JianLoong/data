The unit will focus not just on the military phases of the war, but also on its cultural and ideological ramifications in Vietnam, the USA and Australia. Lectures will provide a general framework with tutorials focussing on more specific issues such as contrasting styles of warfare, cold war ideology, the role of the media, anti-war protest, POW and veterans issues and approaches to commemoration and remembrance. The wider ramifications of the war in Southeast Asia, especially in Cambodia, will also be studied.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2596","eftsl":0.125}
