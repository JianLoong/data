The estimation procedure used by a geologist or engineer should incorporate efforts to minimise errors and assumptions at every level of decision.This unit focuses on resource and reserve estimation of mineral ores and hydrocarbon deposits, with particular focus on the influence of the in situ geological conditions. Students will learn the basics of resource and reserve reporting with particular reference to applicable industry codes. Resource modelling will be taught through computer applications with special consideration of geostatistical techniques.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MNE3020","eftsl":0.125}
