The unit introduces fundamental traffic variables and relationships and examines how they are used to represent both microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow conditions. Analytic techniques appropriate to the design and operation of traffic systems are considered for both interrupted and uninterrupted flow situations.","enjoyResponse":11,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV5301","eftsl":0.125}
