Given the enormous diversity and scope of Asia, the unit adopts a thematic approach to discuss key political, economic, social and cultural transitions and transformations within selected regions such as Southeast Asia. While a closer study of contemporary issues in any particular region provides a measure of coherence to the unit, students are encouraged to consider the broader relevance of the political, economic and social shifts studied in the unit to other parts of Asia.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMG5382","eftsl":0.25}
