The unit covers the aesthetic, technical, narrative, ethical and historical aspects of photojournalism. Students learn to produce compelling images that best represent human events and are encouraged to develop their interests in producing folio work and picture essays. The unit begins with the principles of photographic techniques, an introduction to different forms of photography, and the requirements of different publications. Students learn the skills of issues-based research and writing to drive their visual storytelling and understand the value of timeliness, objectivity and narrative. Students also learn how to use photo-editing software.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2896","eftsl":0.125}
