Students undertake a project based approach supported by theoretical frameworks discussed in the studio. The unit takes case study examples of creating and organising the provision of a service and enables the student to then explore their own ideas. The practice elements of designing for services introduces the student to creating work flow charts, experience testing techniques, and information graphics to communicate ideas and realise solutions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDN2102","eftsl":0.125}
