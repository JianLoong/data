The unit introduces concepts of continuous-time and discrete-time signals, their sampling and aliasing issues. Complex numbers, in particular, complex exponentials are introduced along with their representation as phasors, leading to periodic waveforms, Fourier series and the signal frequency spectrum. Modification of spectra will be described using FIR filters, discrete-time systems, the unit-sample response, discrete convolution, linear time-invariant systems, convolution integrals, the continuous-time Fourier transform, windowing, DFT, FFT, time-frequency spectrum analysis, spectrogram, and Laplace Transform. Connecting frequency response and time response completes the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE2111","eftsl":0.125}
