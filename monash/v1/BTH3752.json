Advanced techniques for gene manipulation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, methods for genome mapping and sequencing, and techniques for investigating gene and protein function, including mutagenesis, RNA interference and  expression profiling, will be considered. Industrial and research applications of these technologies, such as genetic manipulation of plants and animals, gene therapy, virus detection and typing, recombinant vaccine production and personalized medicine will be explored.","enjoyResponse":59,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BTH3752","eftsl":0.125}
