In providing an understanding of fundamental concepts of nursing as a discipline, this unit introduces students to the disparate locations of nursing practice globally and allows for in-depth exploration of health care settings in the Australian health care milieu. Students will study health care through a social model of health and will situate nursing care within this model. A history of nursing and the various opportunities and barriers that have influenced the development of nursing as a profession will be explored and debated. The Australian legal system as its relationship to the health care environment will be examined and students will be required to explore the complex legal relationships that nurses have with patients, families and other health care professionals. In addition, professional and ethical codes will be introduced, explored and posited as a basis for professional nursing practice.","enjoyResponse":66,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"NUR5011","eftsl":0.25}
