These issues include socio-cultural, historical, political, regulatory, legal, ethical and institutional factors that affect midwifery and maternity service delivery at local, national and international levels. Against these factors the role of midwifery as primary health care will be explored in relation to health promotion and education in pregnancy, birth, parenting and lactation, and fertility regulation. This unit works to put into context for the student, the nature and scope of midwifery practice, its interaction and relationships with powerful others in the maternity service milieu, its relationship to consumer activist and advocacy groups, and its role in the community.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MID5003","eftsl":0.25}
