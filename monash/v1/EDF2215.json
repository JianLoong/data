They develop a critical understanding of effective teaching practices so they are able to design learning sequences that are informed by current research and maximise learning for students. They use diagnostic and formative assessment strategies to inform their understanding of children\u0027s progress in mathematics so they can plan appropriate learning experiences. They also construct summative assessments with marking guides and rubrics to assess learning and analyse school-level data from varied assessments including national tests. Pre-service teachers\u0027 personal numeracy is developed as they apply their own mathematical knowledge to investigate an issue of personal interest using publicly available databases.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2215","eftsl":0.125}
