This unit examines this phenomenon from the uprisings of peasants in medieval Europe to the protests of students in the 1960s, focusing in particular on what has famously been called \u0027the weapons of the weak\u0027. We will trace both changes and continuities across time by paying special attention to the causes of rebellion, resistance and revolt, the motives of subordinate individuals and groups, the ways they defined and legitimised their struggle, and the tools they have adopted to wage their battle against authority.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2932","eftsl":0.125}
