Various actions, interventions and critiques of institutions, museums and the art market will be considered, as well as feminist, queer and non-Western perspectives. An objective of the unit is to reach an understanding of the way art-historical discourses promote and exclude certain practices and practitioners (especially due to gender, race, sexuality and location), with an emphasis on incorporating recent research on artists who were previously excluded from the historical \"canon\".","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT2102","eftsl":0.125}
