It introduces different ethical approaches to legal practice, focusing on the justifications for, and criticisms of, the traditional adversarial advocate approach and alternatives to it in the context of different areas of practice. The unit also examines the way that lawyers\u0027 ethics and conduct are regulated and set out in legal principles and codes.Students will be encouraged to develop awareness of their own ethical orientation and expected to apply varied ethical approaches to hypothetical scenarios. They will be expected to identify and resolve ethical issues that arise in legal practice using the law of lawyering. Students will also be expected to critically assess the way lawyers\u0027 ethics are regulated in the context of multiple approaches to legal ethics and disparate practice contexts.","enjoyResponse":46,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4309","eftsl":0.125}
