A range of commonly available sensors are considered. Electronic components and data acquisition/digital signal processing software used in sensor systems are examined. Advanced sensory systems and associated programming techniques are introduced using robotic systems as an example domain.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"TRC3500","eftsl":0.125}
