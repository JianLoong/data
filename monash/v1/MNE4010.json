Mine planning is an interactive process that includes elements of design, scheduling and evaluation. As part of the planning process a range of issues have to be considered including, short and long-term planning, mine optimisation, cut-off grade analysis and mine evaluation. The unit applies mine planning and scheduling techniques to a case-study project in current state-of-the-art software.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MNE4010","eftsl":0.125}
