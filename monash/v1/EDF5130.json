Students refine their cognitive understandings and develop their pedagogical skills as professional drama educators so they are able to meet the needs of diverse learners. Working collaboratively and exercising intellectual independence, they critically engage with a range of theoretical, philosophical and pragmatic perspectives on drama education, including local and national curriculums. Students explore a range of national and international research in the area of drama education, and they are invited to conduct their own independent research in order to develop their scholarship and professionalism as drama educators and to enable them to continue to build and communicate their developing expertise in a variety of educational settings.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5130","eftsl":0.125}
