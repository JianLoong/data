Several aspects of risk management are examined, including the reasons why investors indulge in this activity, how value is created via risk management, and the firm-wide approach to risk management (given that any firm is exposed to a wide variety of risks). Once the importance of risk management has been established, emphasis turns to the use of derivatives (futures and options) to manage risk. To understand how they are used to manage risk, the unit also considers the characteristics and pricing of these instruments, including some exotic versions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"BFC5915","eftsl":0.125}
