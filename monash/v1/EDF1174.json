This has developed as a unique discipline that studies how humans experience, interact with and have an impact on outdoor environments. It includes an examination of the significance of such experiences to individuals and communities and the consequences that follow for outdoor environments. Specifically, the unit presents a case study of how Australian environments have evolved and how human cultures, both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and settler, have accessed, utilised, explored, exploited, managed and conserved these environments through time. In addition, students develop their understanding of current threats, e.g. resource extraction, climate change and recreational pressures, to the ecological integrity of these environments.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1174","eftsl":0.125}
