While embracing theoretical concerns the primary emphasis is on the visual component of the film and the unit is therefore particularly suited to Art Design and Architecture students.The unit will involve a close analysis of films by exploring certain themes and visual strategies. This will be done in the context of cinema history and theory. Students will also be set creative tasks culminating in the production of a short moving image work or a cinema-informed artwork.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"FNA2903","eftsl":0.125}
