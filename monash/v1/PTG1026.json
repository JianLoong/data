By providing the means to increase their level of competence within the Painting discipline it forms a sound conceptual and technical basis for an ongoing continuing study in Painting. It also lays the groundwork for developing interdisciplinary approaches and extending the discipline of Painting into wider fields of practice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"PTG1026","eftsl":0.125}
