An introduction will be given to the evolution of mechatronic technologies, design tools and methodologies, concurrent engineering design support tools, mechatronic design process and requirement interpretation. The acquisition of these skills will be motivated and tested by applying them in a group project to design and build a mechatronic system. The mechatronic system will be based on a microcontroller together with appropriate mechanical structure, sensors and actuators.","enjoyResponse":28,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"TRC3000","eftsl":0.125}
