In this unit, we explore the typical features of these and other genres. We look in detail at text and conversation structure to uncover their hidden rules and understand what causes common misunderstandings. Students are introduced to different approaches to discourse analysis, including Conversation Analysis, Critical Discourse Analysis and Interactional Sociolinguistics, and reflect on the appropriateness of each approach for analysing different types of data and answering different types of research questions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2683","eftsl":0.125}
