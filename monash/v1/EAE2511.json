This unit uses the broad framework of plate tectonics to define the nature of all major geological environments and processes. The unit deals with where and how mountain belts form, how continents split apart, an introduction to describing structures and their significance, and the origin and evolution of magmatic and metamorphic rocks. These topics are essential for understanding geological processes and therefore the origin of continents and oceans and their hazards and resources.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"EAE2511","eftsl":0.125}
