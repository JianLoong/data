Queuing models (M/M/1, M/M/k, M/M/k/k, M/G/1), networks of queues. Multi-access systems (splitting, reservation, carrier sensing), routing techniques (shortest path, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, adaptive routing, flooding). Quality of service (QoS) aspects, flow control, connection admission control and other traffic management functions - ATM, IntServ and DiffServ models. Network topology design and performance modelling, design considerations for local or wide area networks, including GEPON, cable and wireless networks. Introductory probability and graph theory.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5011","eftsl":0.125}
