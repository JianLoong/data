We study theories of oppression and privilege and critically examine approaches to anti-oppressive and transformative practice at individual, community, structural and international levels. Particular emphasis is on understanding the role of privilege in producing and maintaining discrimination and oppression, before exploring transformative counselling approaches and strategies to promote organisational and social change in fields including disability, child protection and violence against women.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3848","eftsl":0.125}
