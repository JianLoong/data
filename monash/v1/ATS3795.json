The breakdown of the publishing gate keeping function of legacy media means that an ever increasing amount of content and stories are produced by the \u0027people formerly known as the audience\u0027. Being able to communicate using story telling techniques is becoming increasingly important in many professions. Understanding and being able to add an international dimension to your story telling makes it even more potent.Based at the Monash Prato study centre in northern Italy, this unit introduces digital storytelling in an international setting. A number of topics, clearly present and well represented in Italian and European society, are explored during a two-week intensive learning experience including a one-day excursion capturing the Florence Story and capped by a fieldwork trip to the heart of the European Union - Brussels.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3795","eftsl":0.125}
