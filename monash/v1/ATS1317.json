It analyses the cultural, religious, intellectual and political developments that characterised Europe in this period, such as self-conscious efforts to revive the Classical past, artistic and political patronage, gendered social expectations, debates about religious and scientific truths, and early European encounters with the \u0027New World\u0027. The unit also considers the history and significance of the concept of the \u0027Renaissance\u0027, and its impact on understandings of both modernity and the pre-modern past.","enjoyResponse":75,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1317","eftsl":0.125}
