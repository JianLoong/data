Students apply these concepts to examine particular aspects of social life. Specific topics may vary from year to year and will address matters such as youth and popular culture, gender and sexuality, religion and multiculturalism. The unit introduces students to analytical thinking about everyday life, drawing significantly from African lived examples and the African local contexts in comparison with other contexts, e.g. Europe, America, Asia, Latin America.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA1365","eftsl":0.125}
