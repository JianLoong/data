Passages from Indonesian online and print media and other texts are used to understand and critically analyse Indonesian political culture vis--vis Australian political culture as well as to understand how the relationship between the two comes to bear on Australian-Indonesian relations. Special attention is paid to how speakers and writers vary language styles (e.g. Indonesian, local language) to suit and persuade political and public audiences.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3115","eftsl":0.125}
