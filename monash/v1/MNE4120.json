Most resources companies invest millions in their control systems for real-time monitoring of their assets. In addition to the real-time monitoring, the automation of many of the processes involved in the natural resources industry allows systems to be optimised through cost and production efficiencies, quality and workplace health and safety outputs.This unit details the instrumentation and automation that is currently being used by the resources industry to optimize cost and production efficiencies, reliability, quality and workplace health and safety outputs. The instrumentation can be used to maintain the assets of a company at the lowest cost possible while still maintaining productively and health and safety outputs.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MNE4120","eftsl":0.125}
