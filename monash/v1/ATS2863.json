His discussion of what this insight entails has set the agenda for modern philosophical debates in epistemology and metaphysics. Some of the questions he proposed include: what is the self? Is it my mind, or my mind and my body? Can I ever have knowledge of anything outside the self? How do I know that I am not dreaming all my sensory experiences of the physical world? Or how do I know that I am not being deceived into thinking that the external world exists? This unit will examine the entire Cartesian system, with special emphasis on Descartes\u0027 views about the possibility of knowledge and what it is to be a thinking thing.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2863","eftsl":0.125}
