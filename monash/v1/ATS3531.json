Consideration will be given to contemporary and historical theorisations of film and television viewing such as those pertaining to spectatorship, the public sphere, audience studies and/or the senses. These examples and methods will be analysed in relation to the specific concerns of subjectivity that may include a focus on gender and/or race and/or sexuality. A range of different contemporary and historical screen examples will be discussed and viewed throughout the semester, encompassing film and television from Australian, the USA and other national contexts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3531","eftsl":0.125}
