Students will receive lectures from Monash staff and engage in observational study of China\u0027s biggest city. Shanghai is the economic capital of China and the site where western modernity first made landfall in the 1850s. Since that time it has evolved under a complex mix of domestic and international influences. Since 1992 it has been promoted as China\u0027s global city and has used arts and culture, and later the cultural creative industries as an essential part of this ambition. This unit allows students to experience this dynamic city first hand, guided by Monash staff who have researched and lived in the city. Students will be given local context, information and a research overview by Monash staff who will also supervise small study excursions of the city.","enjoyResponse":26,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5066","eftsl":0.25}
