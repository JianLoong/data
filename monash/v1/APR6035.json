It considers the scholarly thesis as a genre and compares it with other advanced modes of writing. It also reflects on the non-traditional form of the doctorate required by the PhD Journalism and the scholarly exegesis this form requires. It provides an overview of expectations involved in a literature review and considers questions of ethics in higher degree research. The program will be adapted according to the thesis and/or journalism projects in the class, but the unit will consider literature reviews, quantitative and qualitative methodologies, the relation of research methodologies in the fields to those of adjacent disciplines such as history, politics, sociology and methodological questions in addressing testimony, memory, truth, visual representation and power.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APR6035","eftsl":0}
