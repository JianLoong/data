Introducing students to Cultural Intelligence, the unit will provide critical tools for intercultural management, a key competency for studying and working in transnational environments. Students will complete guided intercultural interactions in and outside classroom, in order to produce written self-reflection on their cultural experience. Regardless of disciplinary background, activities proposed to students in this unit (e.g. case studies, role plays, simulations, reflective journal, online forum) will train them to efficiently interact with, and to engage in local and regional environments. Fostering crucial graduate attributes such as cross-cultural collaboration, teamwork, cultural awareness and critical thinking, this unit will enable students to build their profile as global leaders.","enjoyResponse":11,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3064","eftsl":0.125}
