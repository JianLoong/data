Students will be asked to work at an advanced level of production - either individually or in collaboration - while scrutinising current cinema practice in greater depth.Art \u0026 Design in film is an elective unit involving close visual analysis of selected feature films. The unit focuses on design as part of the visual language of film. While embracing theoretical concerns the primary emphasis is on the design component of the film and the unit is therefore particularly suited to Art and Design students.The unit will involve a close analysis of films as complete works, but more particularly by exploring certain themes and visual strategies. This will be done in the context of cinema history and theory. Students will also be set creative tasks culminating in the production of a longer moving image work or a cinema-informed artwork.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"FNA3903","eftsl":0.125}
