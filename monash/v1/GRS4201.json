The lectures and tutorials will build on an understanding of basic reproductive physiology and endocrinology to explore ways in which reproduction can be manipulated to increase the reproductive efficiency and genetic gain in farm animals and animals in danger of becoming extinct.  How this information can be applied to the monitoring and regulation of reproduction in pets, zoo animals, Australian native animals and vertebrate pest species will also be explored.  The approaches that will be examined include hormonal and immunological manipulation of reproduction, artificial insemination (AI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), intra-cytoplasmic sperm. A facility that is using these approaches will allow students to see first hand how fundamental information can be applied to achieve environmental and/or commercial outcomes.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"GRS4201","eftsl":0.125}
