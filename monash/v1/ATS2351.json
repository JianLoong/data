While these are but one form of monument used to preserve the dead and present their expectations for the next life, they epitomise the importance of preparing for that transition. The unit explores the beliefs that prompted such complex burial arrangements and those for all classes of society, and uses these to chart the development in Egyptian culture from 3050 BCE to 1750 BCE. It explores a wide range of material evidence to track these changes and explores the range of modern theories available to understand the processes involved.","enjoyResponse":17,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2351","eftsl":0.125}
