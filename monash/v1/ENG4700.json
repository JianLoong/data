Topics include: basis of light and radiation, principles of synchrotron operation, practical study at the Australian synchrotron, human physiology for engineers, principles of detection and sensing of signals, biomedically relevant properties and phenomena. The unit begins with an intensive lecture series culminating in a mid-semester examination. During this time project teams are formed and project proposals are developed. Project work continues with groups and individuals combining projects, allocated resources, knowledge and skills to develop a biomedical sensing device.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG4700","eftsl":0.125}
