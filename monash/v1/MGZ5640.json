The relevance of culture to management practices is analysed and illustrated in various national cultural settings. The unit then considers contemporary issues that affect the cross-cultural communication process (e.g.: ethics) before considering the international negotiation process. Objectives, methods of negotiation and ways of negotiating cross-culturally are considered. The unit seeks to impart to students the ability and an awareness of how to communicate effectively in a cross-cultural setting.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGZ5640","eftsl":0.125}
