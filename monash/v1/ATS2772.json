Students will be introduced to analytical techniques drawn from grammar and stylistics, critical linguistics and literary criticism, and will apply them to the study of a range of literary and linguistic texts, focussing on the social and ideational implications of various syntactic, propositional and rhetorical forms. The unit will thus develop students\u0027 appreciation of language as a socio-textual institution, while strengthening their English literacy.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2772","eftsl":0.125}
