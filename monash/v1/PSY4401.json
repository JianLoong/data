The unit begins with a review of univariate statistics and introduction to the philosophy of research design and analysis. More advanced statistical techniques are then systematically introduced. There is a focus on the understanding of the issues that may arise around the choice of appropriate statistical technique and preparation of data; critiquing decisions made to assist in the interpretation of findings. The content will be set in a context of the needs of professional psychologists and researchers whose interests present unusual methodological demands, which in turn may influence choices in research approach and statistical technique.","enjoyResponse":24,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY4401","eftsl":0.125}
