It focuses in particular on violence as a manifestation of the disintegration of traditional belief systems centering on \u0027the nation\u0027 and the emergence of assertive forms of sub-cultural resistance. Through case studies of terrorist networks and the ideologies that motivate them, the course addresses conundrums such as the distinction between \u0027freedom fighters\u0027 and \u0027terrorists\u0027, the relationship between technology, economy and political violence, and the impact of violence on traditional notions of national and international governance.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5327","eftsl":0.25}
