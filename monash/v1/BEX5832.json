One week is taught at the Monash Prato Centre in Italy and the second week incorporates presentations/lectures in organisation visits in Europe. The unit enables students to better understand the political, economic and social environment in which business operates in Europe. Specifically the unit considers the establishment and functioning of the European Union (EU) and its relationship with its member states as well as providing students with an awareness of the key debates, issues and on-going challenges facing Europe and the European Union. These challenges and their implications for business/management policy and practice in Europe, underpin the essence of this unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"BEX5832","eftsl":0.25}
