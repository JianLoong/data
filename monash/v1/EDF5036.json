The unit draws on creative and critical pedagogies to nurture student creativity and ability to respond to issues of social justice through arts, design and health and physical education. It addresses two themes: the first explores creativity and the arts and the second examines health and wellbeing. In theme one, a range of pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning in the arts and design are canvassed and current theoretical perspectives in the arts are examined. Students develop their competencies in a range of art forms, such as visual art, music, dance, drama, media and literature, and in doing so gain an understanding of the content, processes and skills as they relate to children\u0027s development and learning in the arts and design. In theme two, students gain understandings in the health and wellbeing of people, places and communities locally and globally and critically examine theoretical perspectives related to health and wellbeing. Students develop competencies in the content, processes and skills of health and wellbeing and physical education using cross-disciplinary approaches.","enjoyResponse":16,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5036","eftsl":0.125}
