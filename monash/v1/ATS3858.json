Students will explore a range of strategies for experimenting with forms and with themes through weekly exercises, investigations into literary theory, and a focus on the processes of researching, drafting and editing creative texts. The unit emphasises the importance of research (in relation to questions both of style and of content) to the production of effective and experimental writing, and the importance of reflecting on creative work through the critical techniques of exegesis.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3858","eftsl":0.125}
