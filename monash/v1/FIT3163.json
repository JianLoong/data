Projects involve whole or part of the data science process (visualisation, analysis, algorithms, etc.) but can also be software-based, or they may involve investigation of theory. Projects if software-based should cover analysis through design to implementation and sting. Comprehensive written documentation on the project is required. Students are assigned in groups to a project supervisor. There are no lectures in this unit, although students will be expected to attend regular meetings with their project supervisor. The unit is the first part of a 12-credit point project sequence; the second part and exit point for the project is FIT3162.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3163","eftsl":0.125}
