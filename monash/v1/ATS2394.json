It traverses a broad terrain, investigating cross-cultural contact at political and diplomatic, economic and trade, as well as cultural and personal levels. The unit places contemporary events within their broader historical contexts, to identify enduring themes that influence Australian-Asian relations. It also looks ahead to future developments as Australia negotiates the \u0027Asian Century\u0027. The unit begins in Australia, before students embark on a study tour of an Asian nation to gain an in-depth awareness of the complex social, cultural and political context of Asia, and how Australia fits into a regional frame.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2394","eftsl":0.25}
