In building on the background developed in the undergraduate curriculum, the unit will seek to locate existing psychological research in a contemporary social context, exploring emerging theoretical developments and reviewing existing controversies. The overarching goal will be to build greater understanding of the range of competing explanatory hypotheses that have emerged in response to key psychological issues in the extant literature. The role psychological research and theory plays in broader society will be reflected in the choice of topics and issues canvassed in this unit. The general areas from which the specific topics may be chosen will include: population health, chronic disease, indigenous health, forensic and behavioural science, substance use, medical anthropology and psychological theory.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY4110","eftsl":0.125}
