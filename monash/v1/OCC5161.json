The unit will overview and critique literature related to historical and current conceptual understandings of human activity and occupation, and occupation-based, culturally sensitive practices including: definitions and classifications of occupation, time use, occupational balance, person-environment-occupation models of practice, occupational identity and occupational adaptation. It will take a lifespan approach and is relevant to all areas of occupational therapy practice in building healthy communities. Literature will be primarily sourced from occupational therapy and occupational science. In this unit students will also develop the skills required for evidence-based, reflective, client/person-centred practice, critical evaluation of literature and professional verbal and written forms of communication of occupation-based practice concepts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"OCC5161","eftsl":0.125}
