They engage with four-dimensional (4D, time-based) art practices through a range of traditional, analogue and digital platforms. They critically analyse the use of communication technologies and digital tools as well as the impact and expansion of new media on art practice. They investigate the cultural, creative and social effect that new media practices, such as digital art and graphics, virtual, internet and interactive art, computer games and robotics, have on our understanding of art and aesthetics.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2182","eftsl":0.125}
