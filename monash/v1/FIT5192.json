The first module provides students with an understanding of the design and development of systems that support the large enterprise in a web-based environment. Students will learn of the theoretical issues that need to be considered by the enterprise and how they can affect the development of the enterprise application. A number of techniques will be introduced as the technological means to build such an application with specific emphasis on the Java EE technology.The second module of this unit provides students with the knowledge, understanding and skills required to develop an application system, which uses a web interface to a back-end database. The unit assumes a sound basic knowledge of programming and database concepts and skills as developed in the introductory units in these areas. The emphasis in the unit is on mastery of the key concepts and the basic knowledge and skills required to build this kind of application. The unit will provide students with an awareness of the wide range of technologies which are used to support this kind of application, but will examine only a limited number of these technologies to demonstrate the key concepts and their application.This unit will take a strongly practical focus in examining the technology issues involved, and highlight the key issues which a developer needs to address in developing applications of the kind for real-world systems.","enjoyResponse":25,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5192","eftsl":0.25}
