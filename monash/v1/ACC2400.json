Thus, the objective of this unit is to provide students with a broad introduction to the core business processes. Further, given the role technology plays in accounting, with many accounting systems being computerised, other topics covered include: how hardware, software and human processes turn data into useful financial and non-financial information for decision making, methods for documenting and analysing business processes, principles of effective spreadsheet design, systems development and maintenance, and the need to understand internal controls in order to ensure (information and other) resources remain secure from losses through both inadvertent and malicious actions.","enjoyResponse":179,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ACC2400","eftsl":0.125}
