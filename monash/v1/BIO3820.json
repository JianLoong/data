We discuss biodiversity in the tropics, the variety of tropical ecosystems such as rainforests, savannahs, dry forests, montane tropics and peat swamps. The importance of climate, nutrient cycling, disturbance, and forest dynamics on the ecology of tropical plants and animals is a major theme. Conservation and management issues such as conflicting land-use requirements, logging and fire are also investigated in the unit.","enjoyResponse":28,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO3820","eftsl":0.125}
