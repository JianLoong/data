The unifying theme is the role of \"rationality\" with respect to four behavioural clusters: temptations (over-eating); habits of thought (stereotyping); framing effects (is a pay raise too little given the expectation?); and motivational effects (persistence in the pursuit of a career or an ideology). The unit contrasts expected utility theory and its alternative and draws examples from behavioural finance (e.g. the equity premium puzzle which is about the lower than expected prices of financial assets) and from law (e.g. cheating in cooperative efforts). The unit includes laboratory contact hours for behavioural economics experiments.","enjoyResponse":45,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ECC2600","eftsl":0.125}
