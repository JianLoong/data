Together these topics underpin interactions in our universe at sub-atomic to cosmic scales. Electrostatics explores the electric field, potential and energy for various situations, and the behaviour of capacitors and dielectrics. Magnetism covers the relation between currents, magnetic fields and induced emfs, inductance, LCR resonance, and introduces Maxwell\u0027s equations and electromagnetic waves. Quantum physics includes wave particle duality for matter and light, quantisation, wave-functions and probabilities, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, hydrogen atom, and the particle-in-a-box model.","enjoyResponse":141,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHS1022","eftsl":0.125}
