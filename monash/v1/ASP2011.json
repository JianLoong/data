Students are introduced to the night sky and how to navigate around it using astronomical coordinates. The design, performance and use of visible and radio wavelength telescopes is discussed in detail, including imaging and spectroscopy. Visible and radio wavelength observations will be interpreted to determine the distances, masses, ages and evolution of stars and galaxies. Practical work in workshops is a key component of this unit, including an astronomical observing session and analysis of data from major observatories.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ASP2011","eftsl":0.125}
