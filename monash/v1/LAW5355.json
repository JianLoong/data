It will enable students to better appreciate the way in which cases evolve through the courts and how the factual and evidentiary foundation relates to the legal results. Students will better understand the nature of the skills which are required of advocates, their ethical obligations and the importance of the advocate\u0027s role in the courts\u0027 decision making process.The theory covered and skills practised will include case analysis, written case theory, development of strategy, trial preparation and practice, presentation skills, ethics, evidence, legal argument, and communication skills in accordance with criteria established by the Australian Advocacy Institute.This will be of benefit not only to students who are contemplating practice at the Bar, or as solicitor advocates, but also to those who will work in litigation and other dispute resolution.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5355","eftsl":0.125}
