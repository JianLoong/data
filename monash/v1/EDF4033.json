The unit explores how teachers in schools implement innovation and bring curriculum \u0027to life\u0027 for their students though diverse pedagogies including inquiry learning and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). They also draw on research literature to investigate a range of issues including maximising student motivation in schools, engagement through curriculum development and innovative practice, and developing community-based curriculum and practices. Students understand how teachers are \u0027curriculum workers\u0027 constantly responding to change and the implications of this for their professional identity. Students then develop and demonstrate their use of practices that are inclusive, exciting and educational during their course and in their practicum experience.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4033","eftsl":0.125}
