In particular students consider the importance and value of outreach and fieldwork in teaching biology along with the possibilities offered by a range of online electronic resources. Pre-service teachers consider the types and ranges of assessment in biology and the ways in which these should inform student learning. An important component of this unit is an increased focus on the need for biology teachers to think critically about their own practice and the degree to which it enhances the learning opportunities for all students. Throughout the unit, students work collaboratively to develop team-teaching skills while being expected to demonstrate an ability to operate independently in order to plan and implement curriculum using appropriate pedagogies for teaching biology. Pre-service teachers learn first-hand how to use and undertake small research tasks that will help develop their professional practice and scholarship into the future.","enjoyResponse":23,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5124","eftsl":0.125}
