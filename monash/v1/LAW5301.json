Topics covered include the objectives of copyright law, its international framework, what it covers, when it subsists, whether it has been infringed and the consequences of infringement, and proposals for law reform. These issues are considered both from the perspective of authors, designers and other creators and the perspective of copyright users. There is a focus on areas of contemporary and emerging importance, including the impact of technological developments, and use of comparative materials.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5301","eftsl":0.125}
