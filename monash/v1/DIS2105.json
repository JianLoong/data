It builds sequentially upon the skills and knowledge of digital processes by providing a focus upon creative image production for a range of digital media applications. Students explore the creation, manipulation, composition and output of digital images with increasing confidence and proficiency across a range of options and controls available through vector and pixel-based software applications and use of peripheral devices. Demonstrations and lectures are given on the creation of digital images with an increased conceptual understanding of representational issues, visual language and communication.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DIS2105","eftsl":0.125}
