The unit will address the fundamentals of human body systems, and how this relates to the physical principles and design of typical medical and bio-mechatronic devices and their application in the clinic and surgery. A key focus will be the classification of medical devices in terms of safety and regulatory regimes in Australia and worldwide, including in relation to the development of new devices. Imaging devices and imaging modalities will be introduced, as will the coupling of imaging and surgical tools in the one device. Implantable devices for both diagnostic and therapeutic use and the advanced manufacturing of medical devices will be covered.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC6889","eftsl":0}
