Fundamental games programming design principles will be covered, including formal game structures and the game program loop. A number of specific games programming techniques with C++ will be also covered. These include the use of DirectX, games physics, and advanced 3D rendering, expressing these concepts through game creation using C++ and Microsoft Windows DirectX. Underpinning this will be use of fundamental mathematical principles for working with computer graphics and game interactions. This provides a strong grounding for further study in this area, especially related to games engine development and artificial intelligence.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT2096","eftsl":0.125}
