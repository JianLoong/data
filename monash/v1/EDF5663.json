Students examine how larger economic, political and cultural processes of globalisation and internationalisation shape educational practices. The unit examines the interplay of global, regional and national issues confronting education in Australia and in the broader global context. It introduces students to theories and debates surrounding globalisation and education, and equips students with abilities and skills to critically evaluate such theories and debates in explaining the development of national and regional educational policies and practices in the Asian century. The unit also considers the ethical responsibilities which confront global citizens, workers and professionals. Through case analysis, students build skills and knowledge to enhance their cross/intercultural abilities and apply these in their daily and professional lives.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5663","eftsl":0.25}
