Key foundational concepts are reviewed and analysed such as agency, social situation of development, meaningful learning, involvement, zone of proximal development and leading activity to consolidate knowledge. The overarching perspective is to explore the underlying principles of these philosophies and theories through the lens of the cultural contexts and to synthesise this into a cohesive approach to teaching and learning.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4032","eftsl":0.125}
