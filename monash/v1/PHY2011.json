This material is taught through four successive themes that progressively build up the discipline knowledge and broader organisation, communication and management skills of science. Themes 1 and 2 (Foundations) explain cell structure and nerve organisation and function. Theme 3 (Communication systems) develops that knowledge base to study fast and slow inter-cell communication systems. Theme 4 (Sensory systems) shows how the systems of touch, pain, hearing, vision, taste and smell detect the world and how the brain analyses that information. Theme 5 (Control and response systems) details how the body responds through movement of limbs and the action of internal organs, and hormone systems. Normal physiology and common dysfunctions of the systems are studied, to allow for a greater understanding of the normal physiology, and an appreciation of dysfunctions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHY2011","eftsl":0.125}
