The focus of the unit is the ethics of killing. We examine questions such as: When, if ever, is killing justified? Many of us think that killing is permissible in emergency rescue situations, or in self-defence. Is it possible to explain this in a way that is consistent with our more typical attitudes to killing? What about killing non-human animals for food? Like all philosophy units, this unit will also develop critical and analytic thinking skills.","enjoyResponse":16,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1371","eftsl":0.125}
