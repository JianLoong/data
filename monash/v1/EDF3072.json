Students are challenged to consider their role as ethical leaders and change makers, and plan what resources, support, networks and ongoing professional learning they may need to progress performance. The unit engages students in critical reflection to explore current dominant policies and pedagogies within HPE and how these may shape and influence their practice. It prepares students to engage professionally with colleagues, parents/carers and the community with an understanding of the overarching legislative, administrative and organisational policies and processes. In doing so, it supports students to better understand the processes of changing practice within HPE at a policy, school and individual level. Case study and workshop activities examine relations that exist within the education context. Barriers and opportunities to initiating and sustaining change are critiqued and unpacked using various theoretical lenses.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3072","eftsl":0.125}
