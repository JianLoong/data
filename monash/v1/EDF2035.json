Wellbeing is discussed in terms of holistic approaches to health with children, their families and communities with particular emphasis on diversity and inclusion. There are emphases on physical wellbeing with attention paid to movement, the body, diet and nutrition, outdoor activity and risk taking, as well as children\u0027s socio-emotional wellbeing. Local and international perspectives on health and wellbeing are explored and how different cultural values disrupt the idea that there is a universal standard for health and physical wellbeing. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) document underpins the learning in this unit. Students learn how they can develop and apply strategies to ensure the rights of children to a healthy and active lifestyle can be achieved.","enjoyResponse":39,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2035","eftsl":0.125}
