The unit places particular emphasis on the fundamental basis for the estimation of catchment flow and open channel flow hydraulics. The unit will first introduce students to the hydrologic background for estimating floods in a number of situations. Instruction in open channel hydraulics will then permit the determination of the behaviour of the flood within a river channel and associated flood plains.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG2207","eftsl":0.125}
