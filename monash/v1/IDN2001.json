This includes an appreciation of the core principles of anthropometrics, the concept of physical, semantic and cultural constraints. Mapping of control and feedback systems. Affordances and user centred issues around a series of physical and virtual problems. The unit examines the theoretical underpinning of the interaction of humans with objects and systems from anthropometry and the physical world to psychological constructions of how people interact with objects. Students are encouraged to apply theoretical learning with an experimental approach to problem solving. Project work is presented in folio format, documented for production. Final design proposals are also undertaken in detailed model or prototypical form where appropriate.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDN2001","eftsl":0.25}
