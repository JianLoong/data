Private international law (or conflict of laws) is the body of rules applying to civil disputes with an international element. These are the rules on when a court is to assume jurisdiction, when a foreign judgment is to be recognised, and which law is to be applied to a dispute. Private international law is domestic law. Focusing on commercial disputes, this unit compares the private international law of Australia, Canada, the European Union, the UK and the US. This unit investigates case law, domestic legislation and regulations of the European Union, namely the Brussels I Regulation, the Rome I Regulation and the Rome II Regulation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5608","eftsl":0.125}
