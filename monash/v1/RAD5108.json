The unit will require students to use verified methodologies to interpret radiographic images involving trauma, sport injuries, arthritic diseases and neoplasm affecting the appendicular and axial skeleton of adults and paediatric patients.  Advanced knowledge of the biomedical management of trauma and disease together with a detailed understanding of the associated radiographic representation of these pathologies will enable students to provide informed and evidence based comments about their images. The unit will acknowledge the importance of clinical judgement and decision making within the context of image interpretation and provide the tools to better understand and address the issues prevalent in today\u0027s health care environment. The unit will contextualise the practice of radiographic image interpretation within the broader context of the health care system and analyse the inter-professional and collaborative mechanisms that lead to a broadening of practice boundaries.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD5108","eftsl":0.25}
