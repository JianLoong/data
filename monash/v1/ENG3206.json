Students are expected to apply the knowledge and experience gained in the various sub-discipline areas of civil and environmental engineering units to a specific project. This unit will also help develop a range of more generic skills including teamwork and communication. Students will work in small groups to plan and develop designs relevant to the various sub-disciplinary areas of the course. Designs will typically involve analysis, calculations and preparation of engineering drawings plus communication of the process via written and oral reports.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG3206","eftsl":0.125}
