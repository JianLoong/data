The studio takes the student through a number of key studio based explorations that underpin and develop an understanding of the inter-relationship between a desired physical outcome and the manner of its production. This includes an appreciation of the core principles of manufacture methods and the impact upon the design of an object due to materiality. Students are encouraged to apply theoretical learning with an experimental approach to problem solving. Project work is presented in folio format, documented for production. Final design proposals are also undertaken in detailed model or prototypical form where appropriate.","enjoyResponse":24,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDN1002","eftsl":0.25}
