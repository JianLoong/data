The unit will explore the structures, techniques and trade-offs implicit in the study of high performance computer architectures. The focus will be on exploring all aspects of exploitable concurrency in computer systems and the applications they support. This will include considerations of data path design, memory structures, resource allocation and scheduling, threading, branch prediction; alternative application specific computer architectures; implementation using re-configurable devices and high-level languages.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4074","eftsl":0.125}
