This exploration involves close consideration of what leadership in English language and literacy education might entail, including whole school/workplace and community initiatives and partnerships, leading a faculty, and leading professional learning communities. Students research some initiatives that literacy leaders are encouraged to implement in their various professional contexts, and they scrutinise a range of assessment and accountability regimes that are used to generate \u0027evidence\u0027 of literacy \u0027achievements\u0027. They examine the ways in which literacy data are collected at international, national and local levels. In developing a critical perspective on data collection, they learn to appreciate the potential value of data and the limitations that some data collection may impose on teachers\u0027 professional practice and on learning outcomes.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5650","eftsl":0.25}
