A central focus of the unit is for students to use cognitive skills in critical thinking and reflection to build an understanding of the importance of developing an effective pedagogy for teaching chemistry that can be adapted and applied in diverse educational settings. The unit also builds an understanding of problematic chemistry content and the application of evidence-based teaching approaches that better facilitate student learning. Students trial a wide variety of effective teaching strategies including the use of information and communication technology (ICT) skills and techniques essential for establishing a productive and engaging secondary science classroom.The unit highlights the importance of setting personal and professional goals, engaging with relevant research literature and actively accessing professional learning programs that contribute to the ongoing improvement of one\u0027s professional classroom practice. The principles of and methods for assessing and monitoring student learning in chemistry are introduced. The relationship between science, technology and society, the cultural context for chemistry, the nature of chemistry as a discipline, the values that underpin chemistry and the relevance of chemistry to students\u0027 lives are recurrent themes explored through readings, class group work, discussion forums and assignments.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5127","eftsl":0.125}
