Through an examination of national and international education and health policies and relevant research literature, students critically analyse how policy imperatives shape both contemporary curriculum and pedagogical priorities in health education. Drawing on literature and research studies, students critically explore how curriculum and pedagogical imperatives are enacted in diverse educational and professional contexts. Working collaboratively and independently, students review, analyse, consolidate and synthesise their knowledge and skills as they work towards advancing their capacities in this field.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5141","eftsl":0.125}
