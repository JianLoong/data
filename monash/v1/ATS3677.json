In its overview of phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics, this unit will examine what structural features can be considered typical of Australian languages, and how/whether these can be related to typical features of Australian cultures.  It will also examine the present sociolinguistic status of Australian aboriginal languages, bilingualism and the role of linguistics in language maintenance and revitalization.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3677","eftsl":0.125}
