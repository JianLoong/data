It supports them to understand the place of research as a dimension of professional practice and to design approaches to enact this. Current and diverse approaches to research in music education across contexts such as school music, music teacher training, tertiary music teaching, instrumental music teaching, early childhood music, informal music learning and lifelong learning in music are examined. This includes the range of research methodologies that are utilised and the nature of findings generated. In this way, students develop their capacities to evaluate various dimensions of music research across contexts. Students design an approach to inquire into a music context of their choice and develop a plan that explains and justifies a particular methodology to assist them to inquire into their professional practice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5653","eftsl":0.25}
