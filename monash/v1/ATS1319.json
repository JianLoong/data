It considers Asia\u0027s historic role at the centre of the global economy, its encounter with the West and the forces that reshaped the region.  The primary focus is on Southeast Asia (especially Indonesia) and East Asia (especially China, Japan and Korea).  The goal of the unit is to provide students with a solid basis of knowledge in the history of the region, either as the foundation for further studies on Asia, or as an important complement to their Asian language studies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1319","eftsl":0.125}
