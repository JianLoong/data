Specific attention is given to the conceptualisation of policy actors, debates about inclusivity, and the newly emerging discourse in policy documents of children as rights holders. Students critically analyse broader policy frameworks in which key trends, for example, Indigeneity, labour market issues, the changing profile of families and formal education systems, are reflected in changes made to early childhood policies. Students develop understanding of a range of contemporary policies in early years education within Australian and international contexts and identify the ways these influence aspects of their professional practice.","enjoyResponse":25,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5025","eftsl":0.125}
