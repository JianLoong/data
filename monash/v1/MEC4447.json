Examples include turomachinery, vehicle aerodynamics and aeronautics. It is also a powerful research tool and is being increasingly used to answer fundamental questions in a wide range of fields, from astrophysics to nanomaterials. This Unit provides an introduction to this mathematically sophisticated discipline. This involves a review of the equations governing motion and energy of fluids, the mathematical properties of these equations and the relevance of such properties to obtaining numerical solutions. The basics of numerical discretization and solution methods will be discussed. The Unit will also introduce you to using commercial CFD packages in analysing complex industrial problems involving fluids.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC4447","eftsl":0.125}
