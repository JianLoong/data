Through an examination of global, national and Victorian policies, curriculum, assessment frameworks and relevant research literature, students critically reflect on how these impact on decisions at the school and classroom levels related to the teaching and learning of languages. Students work collaboratively and independently to also explore intercultural contexts as they are realised through interaction with a range of spoken and written texts. Drawing on literature and research studies students review, analyse, consolidate and synthesise their knowledge and skills as they work towards advancing their capacities in this field.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5155","eftsl":0.125}
