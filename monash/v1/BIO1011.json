The structure and function of plant and animal cells is examined with an emphasis on energy fixation, storage and usage. Principles of genetics, including advances in molecular biology, and current views of evolutionary processes and ecology are integrated into a structured course that offers considerable feedback on progress and opportunities for self paced learning. The subject matter of BIO1011 is continued and expanded in BIO1022 and BIO1042.","enjoyResponse":45,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO1011","eftsl":0.125}
