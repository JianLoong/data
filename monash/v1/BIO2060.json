It is essential therefore that modern biologists be able to assemble and analyse these data to make important scientific advances. This unit will provide students with the tools and frameworks in order to test hypotheses, design rigorous sampling programs, and robust experiments in biology.  The ability to critique the methods used by biological studies, make inferences from biological data and optimize experimental approaches will benefit students taking a wide range of research and project based units, as well as interpreting and evaluating studies from the scientific literature.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO2060","eftsl":0.125}
