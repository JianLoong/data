In that respect, we will consider in detail the two major systems of dispute resolution: litigation before national courts and arbitration before private arbitral tribunals. We will analyze and compare the legal issues that may arise at the different stages of an international dispute in each of these systems and on that basis discuss the policy issues involved in each context and the considerations that will become relevant for parties when deciding which kind of dispute resolution system to choose. Particular emphasis will be on  the initiation of the proceedings (jurisdiction and forum selection clauses, arbitration agreements and arbitrability),  the conducting of the proceedings (service of process, taking of evidence) and  the recognition and enforcement of the respective decisions (court judgments and arbitral awards).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4658","eftsl":0.125}
