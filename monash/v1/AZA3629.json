The unit examines different aspects of religiosity that are influencing peoples response to a globalising world. This includes the rise of fundamentalist streams in the world religions, e.g. Christianity, Islam and Hinduism, the proliferation of  movements supporting local religious traditions, and the emergence of post-modern forms of religion such as New Age and eco-spirituality. These belief systems are used to examine contemporary life experiences. They are also concerned about global injustices and propose alternative approaches to the prevalent ethos of materialism and greed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3629","eftsl":0.125}
