This unit is an introduction to the science used to understand the Earth system, how it changes over time, and its future. We will look at the Earth\u0027s place in the Universe and Solar System, the formation and structure of the Earth, and its changing environment. Fieldwork, practical exercises, simple models, and state of the art satellite data will be used to read the planet\u0027s history, and model and predict its future. We will also study the processes that drive change within our planet and its environmental systems: from the formation of the Earth\u0027s core to its crust; to the systems driving and sustaining the planet\u0027s living surface; to the forces and processes involved in the formation of mountains and oceans; and our changing atmosphere and climate.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"EAE1011","eftsl":0.125}
