The study deals with both the creation of images that may be installed in actual contexts and the processes used in the pictorial development of visual ideas for possible realisation in other forms and locations. This includes initial thoughts and conceptions, clarification in response to practical problem solving, representation as vivid and clear images capable of being presented to a commissioning body or regulatory agency.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DWG3511","eftsl":0.125}
