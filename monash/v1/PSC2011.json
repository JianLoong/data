Participants in this unit will learn how membranes and proteins are involved in relaying extracellular signals from outside the cell to within the cell where specific outcomes are generated to activate cellular responses. The topics covered include membrane and protein biochemistry focusing on their roles in signal transduction, receptor families and different types of signalling pathways employed to relay extracellular information within the cell. The subject provides an essential foundation for understanding biochemical pharmacology and its use in biological research and the pharmaceutical industry.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC2011","eftsl":0.125}
