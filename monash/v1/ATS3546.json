These can be highly contentious because of the conflicting interests, types of knowledge and values of different stakeholders. The unit will examine the nature of the widely-adopted procedure of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), exploring relevant legislative frameworks and understandings of best practice. It will also examine other assessment tools such as social impact assessment, strategic environmental assessments, cost-benefit analysis, and product life cycle assessment.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3546","eftsl":0.125}
