The unit will develop an understanding of the translation of aerodynamic and ground loading on aircraft wings and fuselage to the overall airframe.  An understanding of the concept of structural idealisation and constraint will be developed along with real-world limitations. The principles of stressed skin construction will be considered in detail. The unit aims to develop an understanding of the analysis and design of structural problems common in the aerospace industry. It will provide students with the tools necessary to analyse aircraft structures.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE3407","eftsl":0.125}
