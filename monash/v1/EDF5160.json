Students further their understanding of key theoretical and pedagogical perspectives and issues in the teaching of law-related curriculum. Through an examination of a range of curricula and related documents drawn from state, national and international contexts, students generate advanced skills and deeper understandings of current developments in the theory, research and practice of legal studies education. Students work independently, collaboratively and interdependently to develop their capabilities in planning and implementing appropriate curriculum and pedagogy. The unit reinforces a view of learning about teaching as an ongoing, collaborative process that is developed through critical reflection on experience.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5160","eftsl":0.125}
