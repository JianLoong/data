Tools and techniques appropriate for design and analysis of water resource systems are introduced, starting from a development of quantitative hydrologic modelling and extending to quantitative prediction of water quality transformations. The fundamental principles of water quantity and quality modelling are also applied within a framework that allows the assessment of water quality in various watercourses.","enjoyResponse":21,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV4268","eftsl":0.125}
