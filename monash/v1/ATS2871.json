This has led to calls for a completely new ethic based on environmental values and a non-anthropocentric world view. The subject examines a number of such proposals and the moral concepts they introduce: in particular, animal rights, the intrinsic value of nature and eco-centric notions of value. Various ethical dilemmas which arise in relation to our treatment of animals and the environment, the value of wilderness, population growth and the ethical responsibilities that come with globalization will be discussed.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2871","eftsl":0.125}
