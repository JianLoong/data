Students demonstrate the advancement of their design research and practice abilities within a highly sophisticated project developed to a professional level of accomplishment. Projects will be drawn from or based upon relevant industry or societal issues. While continuing to build on their capacity as collaborative designers, students will engage with planning tools and relevant production processes that also highlight their individual contributions to the design process. The unit engages closely with the co-requisite Exegesis unit in order to document and articulate their design process and refinement. Students engage deeply with their chosen project and are able to further develop and advance their efficacy in design.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC5330","eftsl":0.375}
