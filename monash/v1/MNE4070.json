The decision must be made at the time of choosing the project topic for MNE4050. The aim in choosing MNE4050 and MNE4070 together is to gain knowledge across two differing project areas within mining, as opposed to MNE4050 and MNE4060 which provides depth in one project topic. Students undertake an individual self-guided learning task in the form of a research project. The project topic must be in a significantly different mining area to the topic chosen in MNE4050. Greater depth is expected in the investigation of the topic compared to MNE4050 since the basic research skills have already been developed previously. However, the depth expected is less than that required in the full year single project topic completed as MNE4050 and MNE4070 together. The project may be undertaken within the department or externally within a company. In either case, an academic member of staff will act as the supervisor.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MNE4070","eftsl":0.125}
