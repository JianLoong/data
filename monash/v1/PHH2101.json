Students will examine concepts and theories that underpin health promotion and the primary care, behavioural and socio-environmental approaches used in this field. Important dimensions of practice, including partnerships, participation, multi-level action, capacity building and evidence-based practice will be explored. The areas of health promotion action that will be examined will encompass policy development for health, creating supportive environments, health education strategies, health communication techniques at the group and population level, and advocacy. The application of these to health challenges in diverse cultural and economic contexts will be explored. By the completion of the Unit, students will be expected to demonstrate an understanding of health promotion\u0027s key concepts, values and methods, and the criteria by which the quality of practice can be judged.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PHH2101","eftsl":0.125}
