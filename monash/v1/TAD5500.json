It provides the synthesis between text-based critical analysis and a final studio design outcome. The structure and content of the exegesis accompanying their final submission will be used as a way of examining the theoretical models, investigative methods and contribution that their research makes to the field. This exploration will enable the candidate\u0027s development of a conceptual framework in studio research and exegesis that identifies the relations between research intention and research method. In doing so, the academic integrity of both types of output will be strengthened. Students will be encouraged to use the work produced throughout their Master of Design to develop new conceptual frameworks for their discipline.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"TAD5500","eftsl":0.125}
