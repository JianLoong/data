This was the Eurovision Song Contest. If Europeans sang together, could they ever fight again? This unit takes the Eurovision Song Contest as a starting point, to explore the cultural, social and political history of post-war Europe. This unit examines the ways Europe came together and rebuilt itself after the ravages of war. Using a variety of disciplinary approaches, this unit explores questions of identity and memory. How did nations choose to present themselves in the contest? What did it mean to win? Did former enemies vote for one another?","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2520","eftsl":0.125}
