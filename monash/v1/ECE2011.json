Complex exponentials, and their representation as phasors, lead to periodic waveforms, Fourier series and the signal frequency spectrum. Modification of spectra will be described, using FIR filters, discrete-time systems, unit-sample response, discrete convolution, frequency response of FIR filters, z-transforms, IIR filters, linear time-invariant systems, convolution integrals, continuous-time Fourier transform, windowing, DFT, FFT, time-frequency spectrum analysis, spectrogram. Connecting frequency response and time response completes the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE2011","eftsl":0.125}
