This unit then focusses on mechanical vibrations theory.  The methodology for analysing the response of a vibratory system to given external stimuli is covered.  Both single and multi-degrees of freedom and discrete and continuous vibratory systems will be analysed.  The methods for developing the equations of motion of a vibratory system using Newton\u0027s 2nd law and the Lagrange equation and the manipulation of these equations to analyse the free and forced vibration responses of these systems will be introduced.  The analysis of forced vibrations will include periodic and non-periodic forcing functions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC3453","eftsl":0.125}
