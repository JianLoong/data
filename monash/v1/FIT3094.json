Using a practice-based and programming-led approach, the unit explores a number of fundamental concepts, techniques and algorithms that can be used to build real-time, interactive games, virtual environments and simulations. Starting with basic concepts in 2D discrete simulation, the unit progresses to continuous, 3D models, agent simulation, bio-inspired intelligence models and search algorithms. Programs are developed using the Processing and Cinder environments in Java and C++.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT3094","eftsl":0.125}
