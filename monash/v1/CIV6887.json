Smart monitoring techniques of localized and dispersed systems will be introduced. The condition assessment and forensic analysis of problem infrastructure will be complemented by knowledge on rehabilitation techniques. This unit will provide advanced technical knowledge to allow the graduate maintain an existing infrastructure system for future generations.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV6887","eftsl":0}
