Students will encounter a range of issues relevant to professional practice in the workplace, including ethical and legal challenges caused by technology use. Students will research established theories and concepts and critically evaluate their practical use (taking into account many international aspects) in organisations today, as well as reviewing and understanding the wider responsibilities that IT professionals are called upon to uphold in society. Topics addressed include - organisational and professional communication; teamwork; the nature of the IT professions; the role of professional associations; problem solving and information use; cross-cultural awareness; personal and professional ethics and codes of practice.It is highly recommended that students enrol in FIT5122 in conjunction with FIT5120 where possible.
