On a daily basis we are fed the latest research findings from a variety of so-called experts. The ability to analyse information critically and carefully evaluate it for ourselves has never been more important, and yet such skills are less likely to be taught. This unit provides an introduction to the basic concepts necessary for understanding and undertaking research, particularly in the social and psychological sciences. A range of research methods and the situations in which those methods can be appropriately applied are explored, along with general research design, research ethics, data collection techniques, and research reporting. The unit also explores a number of approaches to critical thinking that will stand students in good stead as life-long learners, regardless of their course and major.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2831","eftsl":0.125}
