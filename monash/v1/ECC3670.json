We will examine how standard economic theories apply in the presence of market failures and weak formal institutions that characterise developing countries.  The key focus is on general problems facing developing countries rather than any specific country or region.  It examines specific issues and policy problems that are currently faced by developing nations, including issues such as inequality, poverty, population growth, rural-urban migration, human capital accumulation, gender bias, markets in developing countries, credit constraints and risk and insurance.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ECC3670","eftsl":0.125}
