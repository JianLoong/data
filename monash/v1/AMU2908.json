These modes of inquiry underline the full cycle of a research process: from identifying a research topic, mapping research design, generating and analysing data to writing-up and disseminating research findings. Feminist and queer methodologies or theoretical frameworks underpinning research would critically consider aspects such as: identifying research gaps with a view to giving voice to the narratives of marginalised communities (e.g. gender and sexual minorities); grounding research in their lived realities and in specific social-cultural contexts; and practising reflexivity when faced with ethical dilemmas, engaging and representing the \u0027other\u0027 and interpreting, writing up and disseminating data.In addressing the \u0027so what\u0027 criterion of research, a feminist and queer ethos also find full expression in taking action as a primary outcome of the research process hence action research (e.g. change mindsets, review policy, formulate framework for activism, etc.). The transformative ends of such research potentially realise feminist and queer praxis and in doing so, apply learning towards effecting social justice. The unit also aims to prepare students for the capstone experience - engaging with the workplace and community.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMU2908","eftsl":0.125}
