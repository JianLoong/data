It focuses on a historical lineage of art\u0027s mediums and disciplines and how they are framed, constituted and judged in a diverse range of academic fields. Concepts and traditions of modern aesthetics, the effect of late-capitalism, socio-economic critiques of art and technology are pivotal to any understanding of how art\u0027s form moves between modes of medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary realms. The unit introduces key theoretical tenets to analyse late modernist and contemporary art practices as case studies. It introduces students to the critical dialogue around the medium and artists\u0027 material processes.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT3801","eftsl":0.125}
