The unit begins with understanding disturbances, why disturbances need to be controlled and possible responses of various systems to a disturbance. The selection of which variables to control, which variables to manipulate and approaches to interactions are covered, together with the most important types of control loops and computer control systems. Topics include common control scenarios - feed back, feed forward, and cascade systems; ratio control; tuning of PID controllers; single loop and multiple loop systems;  interactions and decoupling; process simulation and advanced process control.","enjoyResponse":91,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE3162","eftsl":0.125}
