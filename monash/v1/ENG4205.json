The projects will be industry-related or research-based. The students are expected to use various skills developed during their studies (eg laboratory work, field studies, numerical modelling, theoretical analysis etc) as required to carry out long-term data collection, analysis and reporting.Students will need to consult potential supervisors and obtain approval from the department prior to enrolment. The project outcomes are to be summarised in a major report, a technical paper and an oral presentation. Group projects are possible depending on the nature of the project and the supervision and industry situation.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG4205","eftsl":0.125}
