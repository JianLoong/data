Students will gain an in-depth knowledge on the biological effects of ionising and non-ionising radiation, and the mechanisms of repair to biological damage. Students will be able to describe the systemic and total body responses to early/late effects of radiation. Students will undertake a critical review on how the effects of radiation on biological tissue can be utilised in the practice of radiation therapy. Students will acquire an appreciation of the potential hazards present in different radiation therapy procedures, and focus on the principles of dose reduction, while maximising the information produced from a particular dose of ionising or non-ionising radiation. Whilst studying these topics, students will be encouraged to critically reflect, analyse and synthesise relevant information from the literature.","enjoyResponse":14,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RTS4103","eftsl":0.125}
