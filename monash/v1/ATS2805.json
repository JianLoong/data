What is the role of music in producing ethnic, regional, national and even transnational identities? What can we learn about the politics of musical performance in diasporic contexts? How does music contribute to our identities as sexual and gendered beings? How is music used as a focus for discursive evocations of place? These and other questions are explored through a series of case studies that include the critical analysis of readings, musical examples and ethnographic films.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2805","eftsl":0.125}
