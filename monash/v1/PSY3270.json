By exploring brain-behaviour interactions through an in-depth examination of a selection of cognitive abilities and behaviours, this unit will guide students to establish an understanding of the mechanisms behind memory processes, sleep, perception and other fundamental human behaviours. Technologies utilized by neuroscientists, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and eye tracking will be considered during the course of this unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY3270","eftsl":0.125}
