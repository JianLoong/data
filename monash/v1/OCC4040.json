Case-based scenarios will relate to people across the lifespan. Intervention principles will also incorporate environmental supports and barriers (advocacy, organisational change, environmental adaptation), and evidence-based practice. This unit also provides knowledge and skills necessary to understand different research methodologies, critique and evaluate the usefulness and quality of research evidence that supports evidence-based practice. Students will be guided through the process of how to ask clinically relevant questions, search for evidence, and critically appraise published research. Students will undertake practice-based learning for 2 days per week throughout the term (135 hours). The focus of fieldwork is on the development of core occupational therapy skills and students are required to demonstrate skills in data gathering, intervention/program planning, implementation and evaluation, recording and reporting and practice these skills in a sensitive, ethical and professional manner.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"OCC4040","eftsl":0.25}
