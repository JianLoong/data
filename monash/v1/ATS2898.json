This unit explores Italian cityscapes through their monuments and art works and their representation in literature and film. It offers a journey through the social spaces of the modern city to the virtual zones of the postmodern city. By visiting the city through literature and film students will be exposed to a diversity of texts, written and visual, that grapple with the complexity of urban spaces and with challenges posed to Italian cities by increased migration. In addition to considering textual representations of urban spaces, a particular focus of the unit will be the urban biography of Prato, from the Middle Ages to the present day. This will include examining how Prato\u0027s remarkable economic history has contributed to its distinctive civic identity, and how the culture of the city is reflected in contemporary writings.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2898","eftsl":0.125}
