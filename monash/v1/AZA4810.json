The relationship between universal notions of justice and differences of gender, culture and belief, and potential differences between local and global understandings of \u0027rights\u0027 are looked at through an African lens. Specific issues  such as women\u0027s rights, freedom of speech, capital punishment, economic justice,  unfair trade, poverty, and migration are discussed within the framework of African-specific case studies. In addition, the unit examines the development of global movements and organisations, new technologies and tactics of protest and the formation of virtual communities of activism.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA4810","eftsl":0.25}
