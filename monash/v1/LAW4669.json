The EU presents itself as a highly developed international organization producing directly applicable law for European citizens and stretching its competences well beyond what most ordinary international organizations have been endowed with to date. But can it also serve as a role model when it comes to human rights protection? To answer this question the course will cover the foundations of EU and Human Rights Law. We will scrutinize various sources of human rights and how they interact with the supranational legal order of the EU. In so doing topical legal developments such as the entry into force of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the forthcoming EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights will be discussed and evaluated.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4669","eftsl":0.125}
