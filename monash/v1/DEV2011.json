The concept that the many specialized cell types in the adult human body are derived from a single fertilized egg is emphasized, laying the foundations for future studies of stem cells and embryogenesis. The four primary tissues (epithelium, connective tissue, muscle tissue, nervous tissue) are described and students learn how these tissues develop in the growing embryo. Topics covered include early human development, gametogenesis, fertilization, blastocyst formation and implantation, formation of stem cell lineages, germ layers and early derivatives.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"DEV2011","eftsl":0.125}
