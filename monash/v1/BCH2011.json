Protein structure is  related to function in contexts such as blood cells and extracellular matrix. The folding of proteins and the consequences of misfolding, as a cause of disease, are also explored. The mechanism of action of enzymes in medically important systems is examined. Carbohydrates and lipids are examined in the context of their function in diverse cellular compartments and biological membranes, respectively. The techniques used to isolate and study proteins, including their analysis using the tools provided by the new science of bioinformatics, are explored.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BCH2011","eftsl":0.125}
