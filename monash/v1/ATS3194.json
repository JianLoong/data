In particular it explores the extent to which religion and politics have intersected to create a particular vision of society at different points of time, with attention to the way these cities have responded to the challenge of religious diversity, both in the past and in the present. The unit thus introduces Judaism, Christianity and Islam through the lived experiences of specific cities with traditions of religious diversity.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3194","eftsl":0.25}
