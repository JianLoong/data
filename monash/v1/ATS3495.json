In particular, we will explore what has been dubbed \u0027the turn\u0027 from representational realism to formal experimentation in literature. Reference will be made to social changes and to the trends of thought accompanying these changes wherever this helps to suggest the chief characteristics of interwar sensibilities. The unit will also ask questions about the very notion of periodisation itself - i.e. can we talk sensibly about \u00271920s literature\u0027 and \u00271930s literature\u0027?","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3495","eftsl":0.125}
