Energy, momentum and angular momentum: planetary orbits, rocket propulsion, precession, fly wheels. Oscillations and waves: resonance, transmission of energy; Doppler effect and speed measurement, polarization and stress models, diffraction and nano-structures, thin film interference and antireflecting film. Quantum Physics: Uncertainty Principle, wave functions, atomic force microscope; lasers, stimulated emission. The practical component develops measurement, analysis, and communication skills.","enjoyResponse":108,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG1081","eftsl":0.125}
