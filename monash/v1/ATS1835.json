It deals with questions about the nature of time, causation, human freedom, personal identity and the possibility of artificial intelligence. An unusual feature of the subject is that each topic is introduced by way of science fiction stories in which metaphysical issues are explored. So the first topic takes off from a discussion of time travel.","enjoyResponse":106,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1835","eftsl":0.125}
