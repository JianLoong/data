It will equip the student to promote healthy ageing and to lead their team in responding to the needs of aged persons in whatever adult care context the nurse may choose to work. The impact of historical and current socio-political factors that influence the way in which we age and how we provide care will be analysed. The body of gerontic and geriatric knowledge will be studied in order to provide an evidence-based foundation for person-centred assessments, care provision and evaluations of care outcomes for older persons with multiple comorbidities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"NUR5301","eftsl":0.25}
