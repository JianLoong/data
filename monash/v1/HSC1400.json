Students will gain a preliminary knowledge of the organization, current policies and policy debates, funding arrangements and emerging trends in healthcare practice. A feature of the unit is an inclusive approach to the understanding of health. This approach will consider aged care, disability, mental health, and alcohol and drug components in addition to established health services. Case studies will be used to consolidate the theoretical material. Students will develop a reflective understanding of their own experience of health care, and  be able to identify their assumptions regarding health and the practice of health care. Overarching themes will include an overview of the health system, specialist sectors and working in the health space.","enjoyResponse":173,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"HSC1400","eftsl":0.125}
