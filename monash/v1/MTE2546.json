Students are introduced to the basics of solid mechanics in a Materials Science and Engineering perspective. The first part of this unit focuses on the mathematical description of stress, strain, and the relationship between them through material models. Topics that will be covered include the theory of linear elasticity, failure criteria, and an introduction to plasticity and viscoelasticity theory. The second part of this unit describes the deformation behaviour of materials from an experimental point of view. Topics include hardening behaviour, ductile and brittle facture, creep and fatigue. A basic introduction to fracture mechanics is also provided.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE2546","eftsl":0.125}
