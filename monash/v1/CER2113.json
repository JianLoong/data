Continued research and investigation of materials and processes fosters the acquisition of technical language, and influences appropriate choices to realize concepts within the context of a developing personal visual language. Set projects still occur but the emphasis is on self-motivated approaches. Teaching methods therefore tend to concentrate on individual tuition and group critique. Emphasis is placed on students\u0027 continued capacity to critically assess their own work as well as that of their peers.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"CER2113","eftsl":0.125}
