Particular attention will be paid to the politics of the gaze, critique of conventions and hierachies and a critical assessment of the art historical cannon. The unit engages with a variety of subversive material and political strategies that articulate the position surrounding these ideas. Students achieve a level of technical and conceptual sophistication as well as a consideration of their works in the context of contemporary art.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"PTG2035","eftsl":0.125}
