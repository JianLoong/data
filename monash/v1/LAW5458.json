Significant laws, regulatory systems, and contemporary policy debates related to human uses of animals in specific contexts will be critically examined. These may include: animals in agriculture; the live export industry; \u0027ag gag\u0027 laws; animals in science, research and education; companion animals; and animals in the wild.
