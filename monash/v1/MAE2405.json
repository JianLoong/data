In order to support the aircraft performance topics that form the core of the course, basic fluid mechanics is introduced so that students can understand and predict the main sources of lift and drag forces produced on aircraft.A brief introduction is also given to airbreathing aircraft powerplants so that students understand their basic characteristics and why different powerplant classes are appropriate to different flight speed regimes.  Aircraft longitudinal stability concepts are introduced, as are the basic phenomena of transonic and supersonic flight.","enjoyResponse":35,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE2405","eftsl":0.125}
