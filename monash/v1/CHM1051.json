On completion of this unit, students will have gained an understanding of how atoms and molecules interact with each other and how this affects their bonding, reactivity, 3D structure and physical properties. A number of important topics such as stoichiometry, intermolecular forces, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibria, and electrochemistry will be developed in order to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry. The concepts developed within the lectures and workshops are complemented through an extended laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.","enjoyResponse":60,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM1051","eftsl":0.125}
