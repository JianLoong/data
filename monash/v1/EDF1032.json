It introduces conceptual frameworks for understanding children\u0027s mathematical growth and explores experiences which give young children opportunities to learn mathematics from infancy through to the early years of school. The content addresses the transition from informal to formal mathematical concepts in young children. Students critically engage with current research, practice and policy in mathematics in multiple contexts. They begin to develop pedagogical tools that enable them to successfully support children\u0027s learning of mathematics.","enjoyResponse":57,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1032","eftsl":0.125}
