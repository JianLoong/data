Efficiency and performance of aircraft engines based on piston and gas turbine platforms is examined along with piston and turboprop engines and propeller design for subsonic speed. For jets and turbofan engines, nozzle design for transonic to supersonic speed is covered, as are supersonic engines. The unit concludes with an introduction to rocket motors and their design and performance for both atmospheric and space flight.","enjoyResponse":20,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE3405","eftsl":0.125}
