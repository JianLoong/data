A knowledge of the physical chemistry of gases and liquids is an important precursor to the understanding of chromatographic and electroanalytical chemistry. The application of these techniques in forensic analysis is examined using examples such as the detection of accelerants at arson scenes, drug detection in sport and identification of microsamples at crime scenes. Practical exercises will provide problem solving in physical and forensic analytical chemistry. A \"Moot Court\" team exercise and guest lecturers are an integral part of the subject.","enjoyResponse":118,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM2922","eftsl":0.125}
