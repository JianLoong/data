The techniques can be broadly split into direct (imaging, chemical analysis) and indirect (scattering) techniques. The principles underlying techniques such as x-ray diffractometry, electron microscopy, photoelectron or mass spectroscopy are explained. Students will investigate the design of experiments, testing for relationships among variables and curve fitting. Models will be related to the characterisation techniques studied by the application of appropriate models to real data.","enjoyResponse":31,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE3547","eftsl":0.125}
