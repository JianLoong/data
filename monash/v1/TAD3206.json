The unit examines a great range of manifestations: the difference in habit between tensile members and compressive members in architecture is compared to the respective ornamental expressions; ornament and the modes of construction in timber (as in furniture) are examined, as are those in textile (such as weaving, crochet, knitting) or clay (throwing and hand-building) and glass (hot and cold).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"TAD3206","eftsl":0.125}
