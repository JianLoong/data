Regulating Business is a practical and interdisciplinary course. It first examines what motivates firms and business people to respond to regulation; and how the internal characteristics and capacities of business firms and people assist them in responding to regulation, including the design of compliance systems. It goes on to examine the influence of different regulatory enforcement strategies and styles on compliance and how regulation and responses to regulation emerge from regulators\u0027 and businesses\u0027 interactions with their broader social, economic and political environments.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5426","eftsl":0.125}
