The content is delivered in four modules. The first module examines key professional and organisational structures that govern the scope and practice of nursing work in particular nursing contexts. The uses and roles of policy (development, utilisation and compliance) in assisting governance will be studied. In the second module, contemporary methods for the organisation of work in nursing environments will be examined including human resources management. These also will be considered in relation to industry and technology reforms; political, business and social agendas; and developmental strategies. The third module examines principles and models for strategic planning and operational interventions for the management and development of nursing services and work. The fourth module examines the role of interdisciplinary engagement and activities in relation to nursing leadership and management strategies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"NUR5327","eftsl":0.25}
