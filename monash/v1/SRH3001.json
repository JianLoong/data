Students then learn how to measure the health of communities by accessing and using available health information.The next step is for the student to apply what they have learnt by seeking to describe the health and the various health services available to a community of their choice.In the final part of the unit, students will identify a major public health problem of the community they have chosen and explore the factors that contribute to it.This unit therefore demonstrates a population based approach to health and health services.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"SRH3001","eftsl":0.125}
