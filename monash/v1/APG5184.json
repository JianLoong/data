It will provide training in basic video techniques through a series of in-class exercises enabling researchers to use a video camera and record sound with some degree of confidence. Students will be introduced to basic principles of digital video editing.  The emphasis will be upon the use of video to create knowledge significantly different from that of written texts, rather than merely gathering visual records. Students will also be given the opportunity to critically reflect on their work and video as a medium more broadly. The course assumes no prior knowledge of video-making but can also accommodate students who have professional experience.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5184","eftsl":0.25}
