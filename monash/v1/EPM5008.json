The concept of hierarchical data structures will be developed, together with simple numerical and analytical demonstrations of the inadequacy of standard statistical methods. Normal-theory model and statistical procedures i.e. mixed linear models are explored using SAS or Stata statistical software packages. Extension to non-normal outcomes emphasising clinical research question. Case studies contrast generalised estimating equations and generalised linear mixed models. Limitations of traditional repeated measures analysis of variance and non-exchangeable models.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"EPM5008","eftsl":0.125}
