To achieve this aim, teachers of all subject areas must share in the responsibility of educating literate and numerate students. In this unit the teaching of literacy and numeracy is examined from a number of current theoretical perspectives, drawing on contemporary research. Pre-service teachers learn how to develop appropriate teaching strategies that maximise student learning of oral language, reading, writing, and visual and digital literacies. They explore strategies for teaching the key ideas of numeracy so students can develop the knowledge skills and behaviours to use mathematics across a range of subjects and in their lives. Pre-service teachers also explore various ways of developing and assessing literacy and numeracy across the curriculum, in different learning areas and through integrated approaches.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4254","eftsl":0.125}
