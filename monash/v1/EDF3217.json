It provides opportunities for students to develop knowledge and skills relevant to the critical evaluation, appropriate selection and creative use of digital technologies for teaching and learning. This includes understanding and interpreting state and national curricula, as well as teaching standards. Students are encouraged to develop critical perspectives on policy, research and broader influences such as the media. They engage with significant contemporary issues and debates regarding digital technologies, such as equity of access, digital citizenship, cybersafety, ethics, design thinking, and computational thinking. Importantly, students are encouraged to practise a critical approach while designing the integration of digital technologies into their teaching, including new and emerging approaches such as \u0027making\u0027, programming, game-based learning and flipped classrooms. While the unit requires students to learn how to use digital technologies, it has been designed to maximise learning for all students, regardless of their familiarity with digital technologies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3217","eftsl":0.125}
