Students will be introduced to the evolving structure of a range of cultural and creative industries. They will learn about key dynamic trends such as digitalisation, financialisation, clustering, globalisation and intellectual property legislation. The unit enables students to link these high level tendencies to the specific context of particular industries and sub-sectors, and/or places/spaces. The assessment provides students with the opportunity to undertake a case study approach to a cultural/creative industry of their choice.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5662","eftsl":0.25}
