What difference does it make if these misfortunes occur inside or outside of our national border? What is the proper role of international organizations in addressing these problems? This unit examines conflicting answers to these questions offered by leading theorists in environmental ethics and international justice. The unit will serve as an introduction to central moral and political dilemmas of the 21st century. No background in philosophy is required, merely an interest in rational debate about world affairs and a passion for the question: what ought we to do?","enjoyResponse":117,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3639","eftsl":0.125}
