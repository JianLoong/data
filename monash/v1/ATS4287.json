Students will travel for the remaining period  to areas that have experienced conflict to observe first hand the complexities of peace-building and reconciliation. The course focuses on the Arab-Israel conflict and investigates  current attempts to mediate peace between Jews and Palestinians,  the impact of the conflict on the lives of people, poverty, settlements and security issues, terrorism and counter-terrorism, Jerusalem and its holy sites. In some years, the course will also travel to alternate sites of conflict, such as Northern Ireland or the former Yugoslavia.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4287","eftsl":0.25}
