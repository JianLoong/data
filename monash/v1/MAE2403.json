The role computers play in the solution of modern aerospace engineering problems is emphasized through exposure to finite difference, finite volume and finite element techniques for partial differential equations, and the implementation of these techniques in commercial fluid dynamics and structural mechanics packages.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE2403","eftsl":0.125}
