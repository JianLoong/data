New insights into the quality management framework for an embryology laboratory will allow students to understand and develop techniques for continuous quality improvement in their future workplaces, and to achieve ambitious goals. Knowledge gained in this unit is readily transferable into other areas of laboratory and research activities. Students will have the opportunity to visit IVF laboratories during a designated \u0027work experience\u0027 week and observe how they operate, what techniques are used and which services are offered. A report and an informal presentation (not assessed) on their site visit will enable students to share their experiences and compare the differences in techniques and practices between clinics.","enjoyResponse":15,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MCE5200","eftsl":0.125}
