The overall theme is the mechanisms of regulation of these systems to maintain a normal internal environment (homeostasis). The body systems that are examined include the cardiovascular system, the muscular-skeletal system, the central nervous system, the respiratory system and the renal system. Attention is focused on each system at rest and in a variety of active states, and on control mechanisms in each system. Students will also gain an understanding of how abnormal conditions can arise from dysfunction of these body systems.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHY2810","eftsl":0.125}
