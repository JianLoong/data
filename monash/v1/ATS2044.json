Through a number of text-analysis focused projects, this unit will further introduce students to conceptual and practical issues in Chinese translation. It will help students to identify different types of source texts, to build up their skills in text analysis and to choose correct strategies when translating different texts for professional purposes. Through project-based exercises, this unit will provide an opportunity for students to improve their analytical skills and understanding of all factors that affect the translation of source texts into target language. The integration of classroom teaching and translation projects encourages students to apply the theories and skills they have learnt in class to translation practice.","enjoyResponse":39,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2044","eftsl":0.125}
