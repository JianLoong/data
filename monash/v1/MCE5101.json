Students will identify the procedures performed in an IVF clinic and the roles of those involved. They will study the normal events of oocyte production in vivo and learn how these events are manipulated to increase the success of in vitro technologies. The unit also focuses on the outcomes of assisted reproductive technologies and its impact on the offspring generated. The theoretical basis of techniques such as oocyte collection and handling, oocyte maturation in vitro, preparation of oocytes for IVF, standard insemination, assessment of fertilization, and the handling, assessment, selection and transfer of embryos are presented and discussed in lectures, tutorials, and seminars. On-campus students will demonstrate knowledge of OHSE issues and aseptic techniques, and develop skills in laboratory maintenance, use of equipment, superovulation of mice and collection of embryos, embryo handling (mouse) and semen analysis (human).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MCE5101","eftsl":0.25}
