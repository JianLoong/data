We will examine the fundamentals and practical aspects of process control in biomass conversion processes, digital automation systems, millwide control, statistical control, predictive systems and specific equipment and systems used in biorefineries and pulp and paper mills. We will study the evaluation of energy and water utilization and systems for their management , the fundamentals of statistics and their application to process evaluation and trials, and the various aspects of quality control in papermaking.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE5295","eftsl":0.125}
