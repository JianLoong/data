The unit concentrates on the integrity of the visual project, encouraging students to refine the relationship between representational methods and subject matter, a quest for coherence of intention, style and meaning. The intention is to develop a level of independence and ability autonomously and confidently to determine artistic directions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MVA5001","eftsl":0.5}
