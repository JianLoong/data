This unit studies the private, public and commercial institutions that supported the composition and performance of music in the nineteenth century and the changes to social structures and advances in technology that made such music-making possible. By examining key musical styles across a range of genres, the unit also explores the rise of the scholarly study of music that emerged in the nineteenth century, a development that fuelled numerous debates between composers, critics and the public over musical taste.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2804","eftsl":0.125}
