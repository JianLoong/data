The unit consists of two parts. In the first part, students will gain an understanding of the relationship between gender and security with particular focus on violence during armed conflict, war and peace. In the second part, we look closely at how gender shapes national and cultural identities and development and human rights discourses. We will also pay attention to the role of the (global) media and transnational feminism in shaping and contesting gender roles and norms.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3697","eftsl":0.125}
