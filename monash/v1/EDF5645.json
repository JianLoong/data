Students reflect on their own attitudes and beliefs as educators towards gifted students and examine evidence of teacher beliefs, competencies and teaching strategies found to be effective cross-culturally with gifted students. Programming options for ability grouping, enrichment, extension and acceleration for gifted students at various levels of education are critically reflected upon and evaluated. The unit explores and analyses differentiated curriculum developed for teaching diverse gifted students with different learning styles in mixed-ability classrooms, and teaching and learning models for engaging gifted students. Research literature applied to teaching gifted pre-school, primary and secondary students is examined.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5645","eftsl":0.25}
