By a series of case studies, students explore extensions of methods for group comparisons of means (t-tests and analysis of variance) to adjust for confounding and to assess effect modification/interaction, together with the development of associated inference procedures.  Multiple regression strategies and model selection issues will be presented together with model checking and diagnostics.  Nonparametric regression techniques, and random effects and variance components models will also be outlined.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"EPM5004","eftsl":0.125}
