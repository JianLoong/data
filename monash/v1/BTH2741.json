Next, we will study the structure and function of proteins and the techniques for their isolation and purification. The composition of biological membranes and the structure of nucleic acids and their packaging within cells is considered. This is followed by a study of the mechanisms of synthesis, modification and degradation of nucleic acids and proteins. The mechanisms that control these processes are emphasised.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BTH2741","eftsl":0.125}
