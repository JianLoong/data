For instance: do cultural minorities have special claims to group rights? Do human rights violations invalidate government\u0027s claim to sovereignty or independence? Can group rights be reconciled with the individualistic bent of human rights theory? Do the expanding rights of children conflict with the rights of parents? The unit also investigates the ethical foundations of human rights. Do human rights represent basic moral obligations? Or are they just a way to promote good consequences? And how do human rights relate to animal rights?","enjoyResponse":149,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1315","eftsl":0.125}
