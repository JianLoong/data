This unit builds an understanding of the way accounting information systems work so that students may use, analyse and contribute to the design of accounting information systems and subsystems. Accordingly, the unit provides students with an understanding of critical information technologies that drive information systems; core business processes that allow an organisation to operate efficiently and effectively; common documentation tools used to diagram and assess business processes and databases; and internal control concepts that can be applied to mitigate risks.","enjoyResponse":175,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ACF5904","eftsl":0.125}
