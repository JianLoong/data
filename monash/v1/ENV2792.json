Using discrete and continuous models of biological, chemical and physical processes, the ecology and physical behaviour of environmental systems is represented by models with analytic or numerical solutions. A range of mathematical methods including: analytic and approximate methods (through spreadsheets) for ordinary differential equations, Fourier series solutions for partial differential equations, matrix models and simple difference equations; elementary systems analysis; are used to explore models, and their use in depicting the behaviour of simple physical systems.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENV2792","eftsl":0.125}
