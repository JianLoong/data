This unit focuses on developing coherent and advanced knowledge in relation to literacy teaching in a diverse social, cultural and technological world. Building on previous work, students continue to explore and critique various conceptual frameworks and theoretical ideas that help them to understand how children continue to develop various literacy knowledges, skills and understandings. The teaching of literacy is examined from a number of current theoretical perspectives and students develop appropriate pedagogical practices that support children\u0027s literacy learning. With a particular focus on the middle and upper primary years, the unit explores effective pedagogies to enhance children\u0027s oral language, reading, writing and visual literacies taking into account issues related to information and communication technologies (ICT).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4020","eftsl":0.125}
