It builds on knowledge from earlier units and learning from professional experience across a range of early years educational settings. Exploration of current research literature illuminates the various ways diverse learners can fully and effectively participate within multiple contexts in a contemporary literate society. Emphasis is given to developing further understanding of language pedagogies, theories and strategies related to children\u0027s literacy learning including, for example, coding competence, semantic practices, pragmatic competence and critical thinking practices. Students develop the skills and confidence to plan, implement, evaluate and lead literacy initiatives intended to improve children\u0027s literacy outcomes across contexts and cultures.","enjoyResponse":39,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3034","eftsl":0.125}
