The unit develops pre-service teachers\u0027 capacity to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of strategies for differentiating teaching to meet the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities, to maximise their learning and participation in schooling. They explore  key issues related to the education of diverse learners including those who may be disadvantaged because of social and/or personal circumstances. These students may experience exclusion and/or lack of opportunities for success in schooling because of  disabilities, ethnicity, gender, socio economic disadvantage, chronic health conditions and/or a range of other circumstances. In the unit students visit and build understanding of  various learning settings in which diverse learners are educated. Students explore  policies, legislation and research on  inclusive education practice in Victoria, Australia and worldwide, to inform their ability to show evidence of understanding the complexities of inclusive education.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1551","eftsl":0.125}
