The role computers play in both the solution of engineering problems and the acquisition and analysis of data is explored through consideration of common partial differential equations in mechanics, and their solution via finite difference, finite volume, and finite element methods. Exposure to commercial finite-element analysis and computational fluid dynamics codes provides experience in solving practical engineering problems.","enjoyResponse":113,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC2456","eftsl":0.125}
