It considers the role, structure and processes of government, market and civil society in relation to the environment and sustainability agenda. The emphasis is on exploring the nature of contemporary environmental governance, evaluating the assumptions on which it is based, and taking a critically informed view of its strengths and limitations. We will feature case studies e.g. waste management, climate change, water management, where multiple agencies and organisations work within a complex environmental system to implement a range of interesting and innovative approaches to environmental governance.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5428","eftsl":0.125}
