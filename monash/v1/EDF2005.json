One focus is on understanding the professional responsibilities teachers have with respect to developing their practice, and building and sustaining educational relationships with students, professional colleagues, administrators, parents and members of the community in diverse educational settings. Another focus is developing and applying the practical teaching knowledge and skills students are acquiring in their course and during professional experience. Unit learning and assessment tasks require students to engage with contemporary issues in teaching, to develop a critical position on these issues, and to consider the practical applications of this position in their teaching practice now and into the future.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2005","eftsl":0.125}
