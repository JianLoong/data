Projects will consist of either a design, theoretical, or experimental investigation. The project may be undertaken either within the Department or externally with a company or research organization. In either case, an academic member of staff will act as the supervisor. While some projects may benefit from group based work it is expected that students will work individually on each project.NB. Before work is started on the project a safety induction and risk assessment process will be completed.","enjoyResponse":30,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC4401","eftsl":0.125}
