In this unit, we ask:  Who is American?, What does it mean to be American, and how has that changed over the modern era?. We will trace contexts and topics such as U.S cultural pre-eminence in film and popular music; the New Deal and the rise and fall of the welfare state; differing patterns of immigration and internal mobility; social movements especially those of the 1960s and 1970s including civil rights but also right up to \"#Black Lives Matter\"; environmental struggles; and the rise of conservatism since the 1980s.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3616","eftsl":0.125}
