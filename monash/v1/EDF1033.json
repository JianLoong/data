Students investigate how environment and sustainability concepts and practices are facilitated in early years education. They develop an appreciation for their local environments and explore how these can be integrated into teaching and learning through extensive fieldwork both on- and off-campus. They investigate and understand the cultural, social, economic, ecological and political factors that influence attitudes and action towards environment and sustainability. Students develop theoretical and pedagogical knowledge of how to develop holistic learning experiences for environment and sustainability throughout the early years of education.","enjoyResponse":50,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1033","eftsl":0.125}
