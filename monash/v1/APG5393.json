The unit outlines several key perspectives in normative ethics, including Kantian ethics, Utilitarianism, and Virtue Ethics, and examines several key problems for each of these approaches. The unit also considers certain issues in meta-ethics, such as the question of whether moral judgements must be relative to individuals or cultures or whether they can be objective, and the implications of research in social and moral psychology for accounts of moral motivation.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5393","eftsl":0.25}
