If people do not have a concept of the \u0027whole system\u0027, the decisions they take can lead to unfortunate and unintended consequences. Conversely people who do hold a concept of the whole, of how a system\u0027s elements are interconnected though feedback to achieve a purpose, they can do very fortunate things to achieve positive consequences and outcomes. Enter systems thinking.Managing for sustainability develops students\u0027 understanding and capacity to operate in dynamically complex systems. \u0027Systems thinking\u0027 abilities are combined with \u0027systems practice\u0027 tools and methods, including systems mapping and analysis techniques, in a methodology that is applied to a range of contemporary sustainability issues. Students will be able to conduct their own policy design and evaluation analysis and identify leverage points for improving sustainability outcomes. The unit prepares students with a range of skills to manage sustainability in a range of contexts and has wide application in organisations and communities, as well as in people\u0027s lives.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGC3950","eftsl":0.125}
