The overarching goal of the degree is to prepare competent and responsible entrants to the marketing profession. Accordingly, this integrative, end-of-program capstone unit will help in translating knowledge gleaned from all other degree units (i.e. the academic discipline of marketing) toward the professional discipline of marketing. This will be achieved in the form of \"direct decision making scenarios\" (case studies), \"experiential learning episodes\" (simulation), \"competitive situations\" (mid-term case completion), \"learning from academic and industry leaders\" (research day, marketing masterclass, marketing breakfasts), and \"immersive learning events\" (industry visits).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MKF5351","eftsl":0.25}
