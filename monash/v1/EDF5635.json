It explores the concept of a capable organisation and examines what is required to lead, manage, and administer a capable organisation effectively. Students learn about ways to understand and evaluate how organisations approach the ongoing problems of adaptation and change that they face. They consider how, on the basis of research evidence and best practices, policies and decisions may be formulated and implemented to address these problems effectively. Students also explore leadership strategies for cultivating optimal utilisation and development of organisational assets. This includes leveraging available cognitive and intellectual resources, capacities for inquiry and learning, and capabilities for innovating and creating a desired future.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5635","eftsl":0.25}
