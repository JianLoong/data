In doing this it covers a range of conceptual levels, from high level algorithms and data-structures, down to the machine models and simple assembly language programming. Topics include data types; data structures; algorithms; algorithmic complexity; recursion; and translation to assembly language.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT2085","eftsl":0.125}
