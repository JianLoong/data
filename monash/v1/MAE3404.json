The requirements and associated equations for static equilibrium and trim are developed.  Further, these equations are treated to describe longitudinal static stability and lateral static stability. Performance and flying handling will be introduced.  The equations of motion of a rigid vehicle are developed, together with the solution of these and introduction to state space model.  The role of small perturbations, aerodynamic force and moment derivatives, aerodynamic control inputs will be established, together with linearized equations.  The description of aircraft attitude and Euler angles are presented.  The basis and formulations for lateral and longitudinal dynamics and stability will be developed. Control of aircrafts will also be introduced.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE3404","eftsl":0.125}
