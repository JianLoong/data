The emphasis will be on the way the brain functions normally to analyse sensory information and to evoke movement, and how brain damage leads to clinical dysfunction of sensation or movement. Details current research ideas on normal function and dysfunction in this area, and new methodologies. Emphasis is on assisted self directed learning and project based learning.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHY3111","eftsl":0.125}
