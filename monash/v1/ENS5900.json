A research thesis enables students to consolidate the theoretical knowledge and analytical skills acquired during the Master course in a research context. It requires independent learning and research by the student on a chosen topic related to the core and elective units offered in the specialisation. The unit primarily comprises independent research but includes some scheduled activities to enhance and develop transferable skills for success in research. Students are assessed primarily on the thesis. Students also undertake a reflective task to help develop and present novel perspectives on their research within the broader field of environment and sustainability. This authentic research experience represents a pathway to a PhD.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENS5900","eftsl":0.5}
