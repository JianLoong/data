Application forms for this unit can be obtained from med-sphpm-ug@monash.edu. A strict quota applies and entry is based on academic performance. Students will be placed with a current public health/epidemiological research project and will undertake specific tasks within the project as well as being exposed to the broader research environment. The specific tasks undertaken will vary, but may include, for example, dealing with recruitment of study participants, data collection and management and analysis of findings. Students will apply research skills acquired in years 1 and 2 of their degree, in areas such as dealing with bias and confounding, developing data collection tools, managing and analyzing data, and ethical practices in the research environment. Students will prepare oral and written presentations relating to: their specific task/s; the research project with which they are working; and the research process more generally. This unit is particularly designed for students who are considering a research career, via an Honours degree and postgraduate study.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"HSC3132","eftsl":0.125}
