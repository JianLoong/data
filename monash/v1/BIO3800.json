Students will gain an understanding of the need for effective Environmental Management, and how local ethics and legislation drive this process. The unit covers fundamental environmental management concepts such as environmental impact assessment, auditing, and monitoring, as well as environmental standards, and valuation methodologies. This theoretical content will then be elaborated and enhanced by introducing students to key environmental issues in tropical Southeast Asia, which will be supported by examples and detailed case studies. Students will engage in interactive tutorial activities that are designed to expand on the content delivered in the lectures.
