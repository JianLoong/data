In the late twentieth century key Western European and American thinkers and government advisors claimed that humanity had arrived at the end of history. The combination of the \u0027liberal\u0027 state and capitalism, they claimed, embodies the ultimate form of human organisation. Politics, they argued, is therefore a thing of the past. Many contemporary political theorists challenge this \u0027post-political\u0027 consensus. In doing so they draw on grand theories of politics to develop a range of concepts of \u0027the political\u0027. This unit aims to examine these different discourses and concepts of \u0027the political\u0027 and to assess their significance for contemporary political questions regarding justice, citizenship and recognition in a globalised, post-Westphalian world. It focuses on the political theories of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, Jurgen Habermas, Axel Honneth, Chantal Mouffe, Nancy Fraser and Martha Nussbaum.","enjoyResponse":9,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4328","eftsl":0.25}
