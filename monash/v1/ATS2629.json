The unit explores new forms of religiosity that are shaping the way many people respond to today\u0027s globalising world. Major trends include the rise of fundamentalist streams in the world religions, the proliferation of revitalization movements supporting local religious traditions, and the emergence of post-modern forms of religion such as New Age and eco-spirituality. These value-focused belief systems reinterpret the meaning of contemporary life experience, but they are also concerned about global crises and injustices and propose utopian alternatives to the prevalent ethos of materialism and greed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2629","eftsl":0.125}
