These skills and strategies include a range of conceptual and communication approaches, ways to investigate and reconsider the context in which we work and live, as well as potential for innovation.  Design Thinking brings together some approaches that are known in the sciences and humanities, such as analysis and synthesis, but applies them in ways that are particular to a design approach.  Design Thinking can enable a more flexible approach to problems, and a more nuanced engagement with the complex issues of our contemporary world. This unit will introduce students to the key skills and practices associated with Design Thinking, and offer opportunities to explore the application of these basic creativity techniques. The course is delivered partly on-line, with lectures and workshops offering key activities supporting students\u0027 learning.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"ADA4500","eftsl":0.125}
