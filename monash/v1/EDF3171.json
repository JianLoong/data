Students explore and develop a range of pedagogical practices across a range of learning contexts utilising evidenced-based practice (e.g., Sport Education, Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility). In addition, traditional and contemporary practices that underpin sport, physical activity and health and physical education are critically evaluated. Students apply appropriate concepts and knowledge to a variety of practical settings.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3171","eftsl":0.125}
