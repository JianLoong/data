Particular emphasis will be placed on the visual interpretation of words, extracting the essence of literary content with one visual image. Illustrations will be placed within their intended context. They do not exist on their own but are seen in relation to other editorial elements: bodies of text, display typography and mastheads. Traditional image making processes will be encouraged along with more experimental methods.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"VCO2205","eftsl":0.125}
