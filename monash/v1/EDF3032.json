Students learn how to develop personal literacy through integrated approaches and an explicit focus on reading recovery and language development across reading, writing, speaking and listening. Students explore a wide range of literature suitable for children and engage with various approaches to storytelling and language arts, including digital and cross-arts storytelling. Students develop their skills in English and literacy including how to critically analyse texts, how to select and present literature for children and methods of integrating language arts across the curriculum. By developing their own English communication skills as story makers and tellers, students gain the ability to design pedagogies for engaging children in literature and developing literacies through storytelling and to develop literacy leadership.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3032","eftsl":0.125}
