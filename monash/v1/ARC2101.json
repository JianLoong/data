This includes study of structural principles and the implications of these in relation to architectural design and construction processes and outcomes. Direct physical testing and manipulation of materials and structural systems will be used to understand and assess their application in architecture. A range of structural behaviors will be addressed in response to optimisation and material efficiencies as well as their relationship to design intent. Projects will be introduced to promote dialogue between this unit and design studio project processes and outcomes. Integral to the subject matter is the engagement with strategies for environmental sustainability in relation to structure design and construction.","enjoyResponse":23,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"ARC2101","eftsl":0.125}
