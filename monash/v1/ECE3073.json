Practical considerations involved in interconnecting logic element are explored, along with software and hardware techniques for interfacing computers to peripheral devices. An introduction to communication protocols used to connect local peripheral devices to a microprocessor, including RS232/RS422/RS485, CAN bus and i2C is provided. Real time systems including concurrency, inter-process communications and scheduling are introduced.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3073","eftsl":0.125}
