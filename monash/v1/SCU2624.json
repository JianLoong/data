This, combined with staff consultation, continues to determine students\u0027 focuses for future Sculpture studio work. Self-motivated practice and research through which students articulate their conceptual and expressive strengths is increasingly utilised. Studio practice is less exploratory and with better grasp of theoretical issues relevant to students\u0027 practices.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"SCU2624","eftsl":0.125}
