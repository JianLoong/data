In this unit, students will exploit their understanding of general and physical chemistry discussed in CHM1051 to explore the behaviour of chemicals in a number of interesting case studies incorporating a range of significant biological and synthetic molecules such as carbohydrates, proteins and polymers and pharmaceutically important drugs. Along the way, students will discuss the formation of inorganic coordination compounds and investigate their role in colour and magnetism, and metals in biological systems. The concepts developed within the lectures are complemented through an extended laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.","enjoyResponse":122,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM1052","eftsl":0.125}
