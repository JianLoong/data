Topics include two and multi-level combinational logic, decoders, multiplexers, arithmetic circuits, programmable and steering logic, flip-flops, registers, counters, RAM and ROM. Using this hardware the design component will include finite state machine design and applications to computer data path control. This will incorporate simple analogue and digital I/O interfacing. Programmable logic devices will be covered, and the use of a hardware description language for describing, synthesizing and testing digital logic. Laboratories cover logic design, implementation, and testing.","enjoyResponse":124,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE2072","eftsl":0.125}
