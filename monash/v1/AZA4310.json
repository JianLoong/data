These pillars are used in this unit as they provide an appropriate policy and legislative framework for children and youth at risk and articulate the notion of children\u0027s rights. Inter-sectoral integration, the establishment of minimum standards of care, adjustments to legislation and programmatic responses are incorporated in this movement. Students will gain an understanding of the impact legislation has in the child rights\u0027 area locally and abroad through the application of case studies. The unit will cover the process of policy development and evaluation and will explore the skills related to the managerial responsibility of supervision. The aim of the unit is to prepare the child and youth care worker for the more strategic macro level responsibility of ensuring that services to children and youth are aligned with policy and legislation through procedural knowledge and supervision skills.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA4310","eftsl":0.25}
