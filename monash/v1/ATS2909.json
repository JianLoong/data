In popular culture and the news media, gangsters are often either portrayed as rogues resisting the intrusive state, or as villains who commit heinous crimes. But beneath the veneer of sensationalism, gangsters have had a much more complex relationship with states and societies. Just what makes a gangster, and what do gangsters tell us about the societies that cast them as such? This unit will explore the very idea of the gangster in modern history. Using case studies from the United States, Britain, China, and Japan, we will track the emergence of the idea of the gangster as a contemporary character in world history.","enjoyResponse":37,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2909","eftsl":0.125}
