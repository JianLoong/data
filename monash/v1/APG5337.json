The focus of this unit is on dominant modes of governance, with a particular emphasis on processes of democracy and democratisation. In exploration of this, the unit will explore the development of formal participatory democracy, particularly liberal democracy, as a global norm through the 20th century before examining the pressures for and against democratic development across the world. From a focus on various forms of established liberal democracy (presidential and parliamentary systems), this unit will move to detailed case studies of the Middle East, Latin America, and South-East Asia to investigate efforts at formalising political participation, the persistence of informal modes of participation, and the perseverance of autocratic and authoritarian rule.","enjoyResponse":16,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5337","eftsl":0.25}
