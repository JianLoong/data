It examines the contribution of social psychologists, sociologists and others working in the psycho-social domain to theory and research on the interface of mental experience and social action. The unit covers the assumptions of mind and society that inform the major theories of the individual, including those of the Freudians, person-centred psychology and behavioural utopianism. It also considers psychological theory and practice in light of Rose\u0027s \u0027psy-complex\u0027 and the discursive and narrative turns in social theory. Students will examine themes such as: identity and social relations; social influences on individual action; social construction of belief and emotion; and the implications of psycho-social perspectives for social care and human services.","enjoyResponse":33,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3726","eftsl":0.125}
