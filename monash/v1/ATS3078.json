AD 400-1000) was a time of both upheaval and development. From the disintegration of the Roman Empire to the apocalyptic horrors associated with the millennium, the medieval world underwent profound cultural, political and religious transformations. The unit will explore those historical changes through analysis of key questions such as: Why did the Roman empire collapse? How did the barbarian kingdoms come into being? What was the impact of the Vikings? Did medieval people think that they were living in the \u0027Dark Ages\u0027? Why did Christianity spread throughout Europe during this period? What were the varieties of cultural experience in the Byzantine world, the world of Islam, and the world of western Europe? Students will explore how medieval people experienced the world around them and how the early Middle Ages has been constructed by post-medieval writers, thus engaging with and analysing critically a formative period of Europe\u0027s past.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3078","eftsl":0.125}
