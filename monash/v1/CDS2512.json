Different sector needs will be explored. For example, the specific and heavily legislated needs for medication packaging may be analysed alongside the needs of a simple grocery item.Students will be required to rationalise the environmental impact of each of their project solutions, in terms of materiality, reusability and recyclability. They will also comprehend the value of packaging as both a necessity for some items (sterile medical products, for example), and a persuasive and portable brand vehicle for others (foodstuffs like tea and coffee, for example).Consumer needs including usability and ergonomics will also be an important consideration for students in this unit. Both form and surface graphics will be explored in detail. In addition students will be required to comprehend and apply the legal and production requirements of their packaging design outcomes.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"CDS2512","eftsl":0.125}
