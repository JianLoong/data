Students further their understanding of key theoretical and pedagogical perspectives and issues in the teaching of accounting and related curriculum. Through an examination of a range of curricula drawn from state, national and international contexts, students gain deeper understandings of current developments in the theory, research and practice of accounting education. Students work independently, collaboratively and interdependently to develop their capabilities in planning and implementing appropriate curriculum and pedagogy. They undertake research into the design of a comprehensive teaching and learning plan suitable for teaching post-compulsory accounting content. The unit reinforces a view of learning about teaching as an ongoing, collaborative process that is developed through critical reflection on experience.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5122","eftsl":0.125}
