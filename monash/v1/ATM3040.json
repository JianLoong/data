The radiative transfer section focuses on the scattering, absorption and emission of radiant energy within the atmosphere and how this knowledge is exploited by remote satellite and ground-based instrumentation. The cloud microphysics section focuses on the development of precipitation, as well as the interaction between clouds and aerosols.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ATM3040","eftsl":0.125}
