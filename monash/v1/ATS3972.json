Through a range of sources produced on both sides of the Atlantic, including works of fiction, critical essays, travel narratives, journalism and film, the unit reflects on the supranational contexts in which (trans)national identities are negotiated and defined. Students explore such critical issues as notions of nationhood and \u0027race,\u0027 cosmopolitanism, immigration and exile, gender and subjectivity, and the confrontation of modernity with tradition. As a point of departure, students are introduced to the idea of Hispanidad and the ideology of Hispanoamericanism as a means by which Spain sought its national regeneration by proclaiming the shared spirit, language and culture that allegedly unites Spain and its former colonies. One of the recurring themes explored are the various responses to this idea of Ibero-America as a homogenous cultural space. Students will reassess critically the nature of post-imperial Spain and post-colonial Latin America from the aftermath of Spain\u0027s loss of empire in 1898 to the rapid increase in Latin American immigration to Spain at the end of the twentieth century.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3972","eftsl":0.125}
