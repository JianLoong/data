We will examine the development and role of cultural literacy in confronting issues such as the mixing of formerly distinct cultures through increased mobility, migration and the internationalization of technology; economic shifts, global environmental threats and the fluid nature of political, social and religious conflict. Specifically we will work with the themes of cultural memory, migration and translation, electronic textuality and biopolitics, biosociality and the body.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3302","eftsl":0.125}
