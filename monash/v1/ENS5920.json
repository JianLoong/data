It provides an opportunity to pursue a contained research topic, in an applied manner, in collaboration with other students. This involves developing the capacity to integrate and apply knowledge and skills from different specialisations. The topic, chosen by students from a list of research topics provided by the unit coordinator, will draw upon the subject matter covered in the course and address an applied challenge in the field of environment and sustainability. It will allow students to build upon the research skills and experiences developed within their specialisation. This unit culminates in an oral presentation and written research report. The unit includes some scheduled activities and a reflection task alongside the project work to enhance and develop professional skills.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ENS5920","eftsl":0.25}
