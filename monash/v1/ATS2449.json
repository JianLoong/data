The unit considers how traditional depictions of media texts as narrative and as ideology underpin many common-sense readings of media representations, before broaching the analysis of such texts in terms of discourse and textuality. The unit also examines a range of compositional techniques with regard to their potential social, conceptual and corporeal effects, before speculating on how these techniques can connect with established textual histories and reading protocols to enable a range of interpretive possibilities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2449","eftsl":0.125}
