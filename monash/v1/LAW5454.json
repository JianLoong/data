It will discuss the phenomena of climate displacement, providing an understanding of the dynamics of climate displacement, the countries which are now and in the future most heavily affected and the legal and policy measures, including migration, that will be required to ensure that all climate-displaced persons are afforded rights-based and viable solutions to their displacement. By approaching these vexing issues in this manner, the course will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the legal issues involved, how the human rights of climate-affected persons can be invoked and where work is underway today to protect the rights of those affected, with an emphasis on Bangladesh, Fiji, Kiribati, Maldives, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5454","eftsl":0.125}
