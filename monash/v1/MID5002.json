Students will develop their existing knowledge/skills by working with women and other members of the healthcare team when problems arise during pregnancy, labour \u0026 birth, and the first weeks after birth. The students will also acquire foundational knowledge of the care of babies with special needs. Students will have the opportunity to study the circumstances that commonly result in a baby being admitted to a Level Two Nursery. The issues confronting the infant and family during this period will be explored and the role of the midwife in facilitating health and wellbeing of the family. Students will reflect upon and debate the ethico-legal issues involved in care of the baby with special needs. Emphasis is given to the collaborative role of the midwife, consultation and referral, use of medical technology \u0026 intervention, and the implications for women, their babies, and midwives themselves.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MID5002","eftsl":0.25}
