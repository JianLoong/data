Students steadily acquire a good grammatical overview of Latin, reinforced by the reading of adapted Latin texts, weekly grammar exercises and vocabulary tests. More broadly, students encounter the Latin language within the context of classical Roman society and culture, and emphasis is given to Latin\u0027s grammatical legacy to English and other modern languages. Although there is no formal oral component to this unit, students are encouraged to become familiar with the pronunciation of Classical Latin.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1267","eftsl":0.125}
