The major Aegean sites will be examined, and the evidence for religious beliefs, economy and society in general will be reviewed. The interaction of the two groups will be examined and their contribution to later Greek culture assessed. As no contemporary historical documents are known from either culture the accounts in later literary tradition such as Homer will be examined in an effort to determine the reliability of their portrayal of each.  A range of complementary data from ancient Egypt will be explored to examine the extent of Minoan and Mycenaean interaction with the Eastern Mediterranean.","enjoyResponse":20,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3347","eftsl":0.125}
