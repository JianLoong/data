Structural, soil, and rock mechanical behaviours will be examined through use of finite element analysis, emerging meshless methods and constitutive models. Applications to practical problems are a key aspects of the learning covered. Finally, the management, visualization, and analysis of large quantities of data will complete the necessary skillset for the graduate who will manage 21st century infrastructure systems.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CIV5888","eftsl":0.125}
