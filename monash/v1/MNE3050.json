For each of the mining methods explored consideration is given to the mining cycle; ground control; potential for high stress and seismically active conditions; access - e.g. shafts and/or declines; fragmentation; materials handling; and ventilation requirements.Backfill is an important component of underground mining operations, as mining companies are challenged to minimize their impact while maximizing returns. Modern mine design utilizes backfill to improve worker safety, increase ore recovery and help reach sustainability goals. This unit describes the backfill systems used at mining operations that include, waste rock fill, cemented rock fill, hydraulic fill and paste fill. Through practical applications, student will explore the selection of optimal backfill systems and related methods of distribution and materials handling.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MNE3050","eftsl":0.125}
