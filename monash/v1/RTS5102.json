Students will gain an in-depth conceptual understanding of the instrumentation used for each of the diagnostic imaging modalities. Students will undertake a critical review of the physical properties responsible for image formation. Students will acquire an appreciation of the Image Registration process and the importance of combination imaging in radiation therapy. Students will gain an in-depth knowledge in the underlying theory and corresponding advancements in clinical radiation therapy instrumentation. Students will apply this knowledge in a critical review of advanced radiation therapy techniques.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RTS5102","eftsl":0.125}
