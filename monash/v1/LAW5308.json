The Act introduces a reformed version of the uniform evidence acts presently in operation federally and in New South Wales and Tasmania into Victoria. The Act is based upon recommendations made by the Victorian Law Reform Commission in its 2005 report. The Act both codifies and changes in fundamental fashion the previous law of evidence in Victoria. This unit will analyse changes brought about by the Act. At least six discrete areas of current interest in evidence law will be the subject of particular focus.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5308","eftsl":0.125}
