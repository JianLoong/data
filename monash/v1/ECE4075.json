The design, analysis and implementation of a real time kernel will be studied that includes scheduling policies, process creation and management, inter-process communication, efficient handling of I/O and distributed processor implementation issues. Students will be involved in a design project that involves the hardware and real time system design of an embedded system with hard deadlines using an FPGA development system.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4075","eftsl":0.125}
