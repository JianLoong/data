Learning will consolidate existing knowledge of psychopathology and focus on extending this knowledge within a tailored therapeutic approach.We will also distinguish between different case formulation methods. Cases will be discussed using formulations that are problem focused (i.e., presenting symptoms and precipitating/ perpetuating/ predisposing/ protective factors), those that span multiple diagnostic categories, and those that are guided by an integrative conceptual framework accounting for different features of a client\u0027s worldview (e.g., relationship history, attachment style, core beliefs, schema, rules/ assumptions, and values).A further focus is the development of advanced therapeutic skills. This unit aims to enable the trainee to use evidence-based interventions guided by various case formulation methods, within a therapeutic relationship that emphasizes evidence-based elements (e.g., expressed empathy, expressions of positive regard, alliance, active client participation, and feedback), and in a manner that is also tailored to client attributes. An emphasis on self-reflection and self-practice will be included throughout.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"DPSY7131","eftsl":0}
