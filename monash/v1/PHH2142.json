In that unit students\u0027 learning was focused on appraising evidence produced by other researchers, and on describing and comparing study designs. In this unit, we extend this learning by enabling students to develop skills in designing and conducting their own research projects. The unit will cover: developing answerable research questions, matching research questions with study designs, collecting and analysing study data, managing research projects, and applications of quantitative, qualitative and combined approaches. The cultural, ethical and political contexts within which research takes place will also be discussed.","enjoyResponse":24,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PHH2142","eftsl":0.125}
