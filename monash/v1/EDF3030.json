It focuses on individuals with physical, cognitive or emotional differences and abilities, as well as differences created by social structures such as family, class, gender, and culture. Approaches to designing learning for children with delayed development, exceptional ability, emotional or behavioural problems are provided for critical reflection and discussion to develop students\u0027 ability to respond to varied children\u0027s needs. Major theoretical perspectives and current debates related to development are explored and students learn how to interpret and implement curriculum and legislative requirements that impact on professional practice and planning to meet diverse learner needs.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3030","eftsl":0.125}
