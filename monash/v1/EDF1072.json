Within the context of \u0027teaching sensitive issues\u0027 and \u0027teaching difficult knowledge\u0027, students are supported to use sociological theories to examine power, relationships, difference and diversity. Issues explored are framed within a socio-cultural model for creating safe and supportive learning environments for young people and include sexuality, gender, sexual health, race, religion and ethnicity. Students investigate, critique and describe contemporary developments in HPE and consider how these have influenced, or are likely to influence, practices in schools. Students are introduced to key sociological ideas and are supported to develop knowledge of how to use theory to examine contemporary social issues as well as teaching practice. This deepens knowledge of and appreciation for complex issues in society and the role of HPE in creating safe and supportive learning environments for all students. Students are encouraged to reflect upon and consider how they might develop strategies as future teachers to respond to the issues examined. The unit supports students to implement relevant HPE curriculum in their future careers.","enjoyResponse":29,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1072","eftsl":0.125}
