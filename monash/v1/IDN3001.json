Students undertake a semester long project with a view to better understanding the implications upon their design of the commercial imperative. A solution is sought to a design problem to which all aspects of the market and commercial enterprise are brought to bear. Project based multi dimensional problems are assigned in a studio setting. Students are encouraged to think creatively to identify a market or societal need, research and source relevant data, develop a product design specification and undertake the design of a product proposal under the supervision of academic staff. Project work is presented in folio format, documented for production. Final design proposals are also undertaken in detailed model or prototypical form where appropriate.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"IDN3001","eftsl":0.25}
