The course examines the biology of Australian vertebrates as examples of the physiological, behavioural and nutritional adaptations that animals around the world develop in response to environmental challenges. Specific topics will include; life history strategies of birds and mammals with particular emphasis on marsupials, clutch size in birds and the relationship to latitude, cooperative breeding in birds, physiological adaptations to temperate and arid conditions, and feeding adaptations in relation to the evolution of dietary resources.","enjoyResponse":56,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO3132","eftsl":0.125}
