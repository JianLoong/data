Starting with an overview of the establishment of the state system during and after the colonial period, this unit examines, in depth, the emergence of the modern state system, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Middle East during the Cold War, the repeated conflicts in Afghanistan, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, external intervention such as the 1990-91 Gulf War and the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq, and the unrest that has swept the region since early 2011. In addition, this unit will unpack key thematic issues such as political Islam, democratisation, and human rights.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2698","eftsl":0.125}
