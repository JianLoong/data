It includes use of design software tools for 3D modeling, assembly, finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and design optimization. Topics on manufacturing processes will incorporate the discussion of a variety of modern computer controlled processes in addition to those relating to composites and polymers. The unit will emphasize design methodologies and processes for low cost, manufacturability, ease of assembly and speed to market.","enjoyResponse":94,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC4407","eftsl":0.125}
