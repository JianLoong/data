The unit familiarises students with a variety of critical approaches and allows them to analyse the films as representatives of specific cinematographic genres and styles, and as reflections on and interpretations of post-war Italian culture. The unit covers issues such as wartime resistance; fascism; migration within, from and to Italy amongst others.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3237","eftsl":0.125}
