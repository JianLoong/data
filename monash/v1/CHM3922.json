This is supported by a discussion of the theoretical basis of the design of synthetic pathways for target e.g. bioactive molecules. The knowledge gained will be used to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of common organic reactions and metal-mediated reactions towards identifying scope in organic chemistry. The development of chemical methods that allow realisation of the concept of a sustainable future will also be discussed. Advanced NMR spectroscopy will also be introduced as a useful tool to elucidating structure.","enjoyResponse":40,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"CHM3922","eftsl":0.125}
