Students research everyday environments at home and in the community to determine science and technology affordances and apply well-developed judgements for turning everyday concepts into scientific concepts. The teaching of these areas is examined from a range of theoretical perspectives and in relation to relevant regional/national curricula. Attention is paid to learning across the institutional contexts of home, early childhood setting and classrooms and students are expected to research and conceptualise both pedagogies and programs in ways that promote and meaningfully engage young children\u0027s learning of science, technology and environment.","enjoyResponse":100,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3035","eftsl":0.125}
