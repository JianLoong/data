It will provide students with knowledge of how to build and manipulate digital models, using the following CAD (Computer Aided Design) software; Rhino (Rhinoceros 3D), MeshMixer \u0026 3D Coat. In addition to \u0027first principle\u0027 modelling, there will be an introduction to the creation of digital models using 3D scanning and photogrammetry technology. Students will also be exploring visualisation imaging using complimentary rendering software Vray, and will be producing physical outputs of their digital models utilising laser.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"FNA2003","eftsl":0.125}
