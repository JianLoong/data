It consists of two 12-lecture sub-units and laboratory work. Key areas are:  Nuclear Physics: nuclear systematics, nuclear forces, potentials and energy spectra, shell model concepts, with the aim of understanding the formation of low-lying excited states, nuclear decay modes, nucleon emission, beta decay and EM transitions. Elementary Particles: experimental methods used in contemporary particle physics and the fundamental properties that classify leptons, hadrons and quarks, the role of conservation laws and symmetry in the production of and interactions between elementary particles, quantum chromo-dynamics, strong and weak interactions, the cosmological implications. Laboratory work: experimental laboratory work on relevant topics.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHS3062","eftsl":0.125}
