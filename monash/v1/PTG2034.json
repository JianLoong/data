Hybridised methods acknowledging the interelation of the aural and the visual will be investigated in contemporary practice and through encounters with the history of sound art and performance. Particular attention will be paid to cross disciplinary aspects of sound in relation to painting. The unit engages with a variety of material and technical strategies enabling students to achieve a level of technical and conceptual sophistication as well as a consideration of their works in the context of contemporary art.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"PTG2034","eftsl":0.125}
