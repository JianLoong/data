The work of teachers must recognise the way in which communities within and beyond the school operate as sites of learning. Teachers focus on the crucial work of building and maintaining relationships with families and care givers and in creating partnerships with them and others in the broader education community. The unit enables students to identify the key education stakeholders in their school and its community and then develop the skills and knowledge to build relationships and create partnerships across networks. Students have the opportunity to consider the ethics and protocols of engaging with diverse families and communities as well as establishing sustainable partnerships with diverse stakeholders. Students both investigate partnerships and actively contribute to building sustainable partnerships.","enjoyResponse":173,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4122","eftsl":0.125}
