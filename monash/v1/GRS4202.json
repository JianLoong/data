These techniques involve in vitro fertilization (IVF) and therefore require a sound knowledge of reproductive endocrinology, cell biology and specific techniques involved in the handling and maturation of human sperm and ova.  Micromanipulation is an important new method required for fertilization (intracytoplasmic sperm injection - ICSI) and chromosome or genetic diagnosis (embryo biopsy for fluorescent in situ hybridisation - FISH, or polymerase chain reaction - PCR amplification of genomic DNA).  This unit also involves the new and rapidly changing areas of cell and tissue cryobiology and transplantation.  Specific tests are now also evolving for assessment of embryo viability, particularly now that embryos can be grown successfully to late preimplantation stages of development.  These new techniques are presented in the context of laboratory quality assurance and the ethical and legal frameworks of local legislation and regulation.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"GRS4202","eftsl":0.125}
