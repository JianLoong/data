It allows students to translate real-world forces into abstract form for engineering modelling of a range of common problems found in industry and gain knowledge of the relationship between analysis and design. Students will be exposed to a wide range of analytical tools and modeling philosophies. To complement these analytical solution techniques, students will now be taught the fundamentals of finite element analysis.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC3455","eftsl":0.125}
