Students will gain in-depth knowledge on research methods. Students will be able to analyse and describe quantitative and qualitative research designs, and demonstrate how to apply these to the field of radiation therapy. Different methods of data collection, analysis, interpretation, communication and subsequent critique of the findings will be presented. The unit will allow an in-depth exploration of the evidence-based practice paradigm and students will demonstrate how research findings can influence patient care and management in radiation therapy. Whilst studying these topics, students will be encouraged to critically reflect, analyse and synthesise relevant information from the literature, reflecting on their experiences from clinical practice to further develop and build their skills of critical analysis.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RTS5105","eftsl":0.125}
