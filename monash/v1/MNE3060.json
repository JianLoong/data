The impact on blast behaviour of rock mass properties, structure and discontinuities and rock breakage and fragmentation will be addressed. Drilling and blasting techniques will be explored in relation to design, safety, security, environmental impacts and relevant legislation. This will be done in the context of mine-to-mill.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MNE3060","eftsl":0.125}
