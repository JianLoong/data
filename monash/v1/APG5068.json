The unit examines the discourse of \u0027creative city\u0027 in academic and policy-oriented literature as a form of urban governance, city branding, urban regeneration and community-based arts and cultural interventions. It will use key case studies to link these discourses to concrete situations, requiring the students to bring their own experiences and take an active stance towards the aspirations and problematics embedded within these cases. There will be small limited fieldwork (normally within Melbourne) in order that students can lead and participate in workshop sessions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5068","eftsl":0.25}
