Students will receive an introduction to the mathematical theory of numerical methods for linear algebra (with derivations of the methods and some proofs). This will broadly include methods for solving linear systems of equations, least-squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and other matrix decompositions. Special attention will be paid to conditioning and stability, dense versus sparse problems, and direct versus iterative solution techniques. Students will learn to implement the computational methods efficiently, and will learn how to thoroughly test their implementations for accuracy and performance. Students will work on realistic matrix models for applications in a variety of fields. Applications may include, for example: computation of electrostatic potentials and heat conduction problems; eigenvalue problems for electronic structure calculation; ranking algorithms for webpages; algorithms for movie recommendation, classification of handwritten digits, and document clustering; and principal component analysis in data science.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MTH3320","eftsl":0.125}
