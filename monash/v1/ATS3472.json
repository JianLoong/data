The unit challenges students to analyse the stereotypes and understandings of crime in Australia, especially as they relate to regional and rural environments. Students will test the assumption that crime in the modern world is primarily an urban phenomenon. The impact of crime on local communities, especially violent crime, will be examined. The unit will explore the complexity of contemporary crime and the responses that it generates from local communities and the formal criminal justice system. The role of law and order campaigns to manage changes in crime and violence patterns will be examined. Regional and rural crime prevention programs will be assessed. The unit will consider the role of remoteness (geographical, social and political) in cycles of violence and the responses of the criminal justice institutions.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3472","eftsl":0.125}
