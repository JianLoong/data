It extends knowledge of the basic physical principles of MRI and addresses safety and the protocols and processing methods used to image the brain, spine, upper abdomen, pelvis and the knee and shoulder. The unit will introduce the student to the concept of evidence - based health care practice and how the principles apply to MRI radiography practice. The unit will examine the role played by the radiographer in the operationalization of safety principles within the MRI suite. Clinical indications and the preparation of the patient including the correct positioning methods for the brain, spine, upper abdomen, pelvis, knee and shoulder will be addressed. The purpose of the common sequences used to image the specific organs and structures will be covered and students will learn how to select the most appropriate imaging protocol for the common sequences from within an evidence - based framework. The unit will enable students to recognise the characteristics of the MRI representation of the common pathologies affecting the brain, spine, upper abdomen, pelvis, knee and shoulder. The unit will conclude with an examination of the application of quality assurance and quality control principles to MRI imaging.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RAD4501","eftsl":0.125}
