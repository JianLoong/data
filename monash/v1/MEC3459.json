Students will be instructed on the fundamentals of the role of composition and structure of materials in their mechanical properties that are important for engineering design.  Students will also learn how the materials with undesirable microstructure can lead to premature failures, particularly as a result of their interaction with aggressive environment.  The knowledge thus developed will provide a basis for advanced learning on a systematic approach to materials selection as well as the methods by which the materials with the desired mechanical properties can be processed.  Case studies will be presented to highlight the importance of selecting appropriate materials for engineering design.","enjoyResponse":108,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MEC3459","eftsl":0.125}
