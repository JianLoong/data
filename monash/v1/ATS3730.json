As the world urgently searches for pathways towards greater sustainability, it is critical to understand the social, cultural, institutional, political and economic dimensions of these global environmental drivers and potential solutions. This unit explores these issues, with a view to understanding the policy reforms institutional arrangements, citizen attitudes and behaviours, economic frameworks, media influences, and broader social changes needed to create sustainable societies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3730","eftsl":0.125}
