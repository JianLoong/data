This unit introduces you to a small selection of areas, including: Social psychology: how other people and the social environment influence how we think and behave - e.g., conformity, aggression, stereotypes and prejudice. Cognitive psychology: the exploration of internal mental processes - e.g., the fallible nature of memory, how it works and is influenced by others. Abnormal psychology: what happens when our thoughts, feelings, or behaviour cause distress, and interfere with our ability to function - e.g., depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.You will also examine how psychologists acquire further knowledge and test their understanding of the way in which individuals think, feel, and behave. This will involve an introduction to research methodology (e.g., research design, descriptive statistics, and inferential statistics).","enjoyResponse":441,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PSY1022","eftsl":0.125}
