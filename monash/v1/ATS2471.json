Policing structures, functions and practices are examined. The unit explores how the courts of selected countries conduct criminal trials. The fairness and effectiveness of sentencing and punishment will be analysed. Penal policy and prisoner rights will be considered as well as recent innovative non-custodial sanctions. The dismantling of geographical boundaries has hastened the spread of transnational organised crime networks. This unit offers a comparative perspective of the nature of transnational crime and the national and international efforts to identify and control such activities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2471","eftsl":0.125}
