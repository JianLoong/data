This, combined with staff consultation, starts to determine students\u0027 focuses for future printmedia studio work. The emphasis shifts away from set projects towards self-motivated practice and research through which students articulate their conceptual and expressive strengths. Studio practice is still exploratory but with better grasp of theoretical issues relevant to students\u0027 practices.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"PRM2414","eftsl":0.125}
