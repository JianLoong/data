These are Theme 1 Personal and Professional Development; Theme 2 Population, Society and Health; Theme 3 Fundamental Knowledge of Health Science; Theme 4 Applied Practice; and Theme 5 Research. Problem based learning (PBL) and written activities provide the opportunities for integration of the different themes within the course. Students undertake a range of written assessment tasks during this unit as well as attending one post clinical campus-based week, providing them the opportunity to apply integrated knowledge and skills from previous learning in the Bachelor of Physiotherapy to patient care issues in a range of settings.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"PTY3462","eftsl":0.125}
