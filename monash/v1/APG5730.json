The unit focuses initially on what values the state ought to promote, and the formulation of public policy in democratic pluralist societies. These political moralities are then used to examine current law and public policy in areas of bioethical concern, such as abortion, pre-birth testing, embryonic stem cell research, reproductive cloning, surrogate motherhood, voluntary euthanasia, and the treatment of newborn infants with severe disabilities. The unit also considers law and public policy in relation to informed consent, conflict of interest, and the regulation of research on humans.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5730","eftsl":0.25}
