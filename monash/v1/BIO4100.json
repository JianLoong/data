Under the supervision of an academic in the School of Biological Sciences, students immerse themselves in the literature surrounding their chosen field of research, design novel research projects that will lead to new understanding in the field, and then set about testing these questions. Students will experience working in a lab group environment, working side-by-side with PhD students and professional researchers. Students present the results of their research projects via an oral presentation and written thesis.Candidates may commence the honours year at the beginning of either First or Second Semester (July). Further information is available from the course coordinators and at a meeting held with prospective students during Second Semester of third year.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO4100","eftsl":0.75}
