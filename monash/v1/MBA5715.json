It will provide participants with a basic understanding of the key strategic concepts in marketing and their application in an organisation. The key question it will seek to answer is: \"how should managers strategically manage their market offerings to enable value for their firms, their customers, and business partners?\" The course will address diverse situations of marketing to consumers and business customers, product and service-oriented businesses, domestic and global firms, and business and social organisations. The predominant pedagogy is case-based, and thus classroom discussion will emphasise strategic decision-making situations. The decision orientation will be supplemented with contemporary scholarly thought on effective marketing strategies.","enjoyResponse":33,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MBA5715","eftsl":0.125}
