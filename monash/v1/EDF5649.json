Students explore the importance of language and literacies in a range of social, cultural and communication phenomena, and examine the mediating influence of culture and new technologies on teaching and learning across a range of contexts. In exploring these issues, the unit provides theoretical and practical tools for education professionals to deploy in their workplaces or communities and in their own ongoing professional learning. The approach to inquiry in this unit demonstrates the ways language and literacy curriculum influences the wider politics and practice of education. Similarly, students undertake critical research into the language and literacy practices and/or the curriculum in the educational contexts with which they are familiar.","enjoyResponse":1,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5649","eftsl":0.25}
