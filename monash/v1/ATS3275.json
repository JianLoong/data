It helped turn Europe into a zone of peace and contributed to the consolidation of democracy in the post-fascist and communist eras.  Yet it is also a polity in profound crisis.  It is challenged from within by critics of its own democratic credentials in the wake of the Eurozone crisis and from without by security threats from a resurgent Russia and an influx of refugees.  Students completing this unit in Prato will gain a deep understanding of the origins of today\u0027s European Union and the pathologies of its multiple crises.  They will simulate policy paths out of the EU\u0027s \u0027wicked\u0027 problems and leave Prato equipped to respond to the global repercussions of the challenges facing the \u0027new Old World\u0027.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3275","eftsl":0.125}
