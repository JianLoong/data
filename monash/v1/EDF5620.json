In this unit, both research and practice are used to view the challenges and work of leading educational projects, organisations and institutions. It considers the nature of professional leadership work in educational contexts where global as well as national-local imperatives are significant. Leadership is considered as a relational and collaborative activity that reaches into all parts of an organisation and is not confined to the work of senior staff or designated positions. Through this unit, students come to understand three aspects of the practical work of being a professional who leads in learning contexts: assessing research knowledge, understanding policy and practice in context, and developing understandings of the self, organisational capability and strategic leadership. This understanding is achieved specifically through students\u0027 investigation of a case or problem of educational change in a specific setting of their own choice.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5620","eftsl":0.25}
