Topics covered in the unit include cell biology and biomechanics at the cellular level, biocompatibility, tissue engineering and other composite material/cell applications, The use of stem cells in conjunction with materials and the use of materials to guide cellular fates and properties is of high relevance. A detailed study of medical additive manufacturing (3D printing) in metals, polymers and cells will be provided. Strong connection to how materials can contribute to solutions that address unmet clinical need will be made throughout the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE6885","eftsl":0}
