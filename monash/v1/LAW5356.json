The unit will begin with criminological perspectives on the nature of white collar and corporate crime. The place of criminal liability in the overall scheme of commercial regulation will then be examined, including discussion of the rationales behind imposing liability on corporations and/or individuals, and whether that liability should be civil or criminal. The role of specialist agencies will also be discussed, together with procedural issues associated with white collar and corporate crime.","enjoyResponse":3,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5356","eftsl":0.125}
