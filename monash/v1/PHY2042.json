It examines the roles of three major body systems that are vital for homeostasis: the respiratory system and gas exchange, the cardiovascular system and delivery of blood and nutrients, and the kidneys and their role in maintaining body fluid composition. Attention is focused on each system at rest and in a variety of active states, and on control mechanisms in each system. In addition to the core physiology, disease states associated with dysfunctions of these systems are also studied, to allow for a greater understanding and appreciation of both the normal physiology and dysfunction of these systems.","enjoyResponse":101,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHY2042","eftsl":0.125}
