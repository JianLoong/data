The core of the unit involves students working in groups on carefully selected mathematics problems that focus on the relationship between statistics and probability, and their practical relevance. Carefully chosen problems, together with whole-class discussion emerging from students\u0027 work on the problems, challenge students to develop a capacity to critically evaluate chance and data concepts, as well as statistical information, and be fluent in certain content and proficiency skills, definitions and vocabulary. Importantly, students are encouraged to view learning as supported by dialogue and to develop their own understandings through working with others\u0027 thinking on a topic. Students learn to communicate mathematical ideas effectively, using a range of media including information and communication technologies (ICTs).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF3161","eftsl":0.125}
