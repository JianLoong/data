Identified by UNESCO as an environment and cultural landscape worth preserving, the region is under immense pressure due to climate change, rural depopulation, abandonment of agricultural lands, landscape instability, and burgeoning tourism. Problems of integrating tourism and agricultural objectives, while minimising negative environmental and cultural impacts, will be explored and possible solutions for regional sustainability proposed. The unit provides unique opportunities for interaction with staff of the National Park and various local and national authorities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"EAE3900","eftsl":0.125}
