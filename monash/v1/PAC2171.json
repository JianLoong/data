It also seeks to provide students with an appreciation of the drug design process and the methods used to synthesise and establish the structure of drug molecules. The subject provides a firm foundation for the subsequent Basis of Drug Action II unit, as well as the \"Integrated Therapeutics\" 3rd year subjects, which focus on describing the major classes of drugs and how they function.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PAC2171","eftsl":0.125}
