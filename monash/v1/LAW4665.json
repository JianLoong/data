However, these technologies may also be used to commit or facilitate the commission of crimes; so-called \u0027cybercrimes\u0027. The transnational nature of modern communications means that cybercrime is a global problem; with offender and victim potentially located anywhere in the world. Adopting a comparative approach, this unit provides an overview of the challenges of cybercrime, and legal responses to those challenges. Topics to be covered include cybercrime investigations, hacking, identity theft, child exploitation offences, and online harassment. Although drawing primarily upon the experience of common law jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States), these responses will be considered in light of the principal international instrument in the area; the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. There will also be discussion of international efforts to achieve harmonisation of cybercrime laws.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4665","eftsl":0.125}
