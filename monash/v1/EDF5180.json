Students continue to improve their skill, knowledge and expertise in developing curriculum design for the classroom through studio-based practices. Creative classroom pedagogies are explored and include a discussion of the interdisciplinary relationships between artists, designers and educators and their impact on student experiences at secondary school and beyond. Through critical engagement with educational literature, students engage with both philosophical approaches to art education and the formal links to prescribed curricula. This unit offers a focus on senior secondary assessment tasks, unit development and curriculum.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5180","eftsl":0.125}
