Students continue to work autonomously within an individually approved program of study as lecturers encourage the self-motivation, self-appraisal and professional responsibility required of the practising artist. A coordinator supervises the program and gives guidance as it is required and at the request of the students. Students continue to critically appraise their work and consolidate all conceptual, aesthetic and technical issues that relate to the individual direction of their printmedia work.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"PRM3416","eftsl":0.25}
