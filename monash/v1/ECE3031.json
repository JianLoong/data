Initially tools for the modelling, analysis and design of continuous-time systems are briefly presented. Following this, the main focus is shifted to the analysis and design of modern discrete-time and hybrid sampled-data systems. For analysis, difference equations, z-transforms, transfer functions, frequency response, and state-space models are covered, as also is computer-based system identification. For design, pole-placement, and state feedback, state estimation, and linear quadratic optimal design are covered. Aspects of robust and non-linear control are also introduced.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE3031","eftsl":0.125}
