Students will be introduced to the physiological basis of disease. Each organ and system will be considered, and one or more examples of disease states which are amenable to pharmacotherapy will be discussed in detail. The course aims to provide a basic understanding of the functions of organs and systems such as the nervous, cardiovascular and endocrinological systems; however, an equal emphasis will be placed on one of the key components of drug discovery, the choice of therapeutic target based on a thorough understanding of the disease process. The principle aim of this subject is to provide students with an understanding of basic biological principles and how these can be applied in pharmaceutical sciences as a basis for later work in other subjects within the course.Topics to be covered include: cells, tissues, organs and systems membranes DNA replication, gene transcription and translation the nervous system cardiovascular physiology endocrinology","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC1011","eftsl":0.125}
