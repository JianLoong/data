It prepares them for professional practice by giving them the opportunities to plan and implement whole programs, design and manage learning environments and develop professional relationships with students, other colleagues, parents and the wider community. Utilising information and communication technologies (ICTs) in planning for and delivering sessions forms part of this unit. The professional placement enables students to refine and research their own practice and recognise what constitutes best practice in the profession.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4311","eftsl":0.125}
