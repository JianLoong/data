Drawing from Australian and international experiences, this unit is divided into three key modules:  theorising policing, whereby we move beyond examining police and policing solely in regards to state intervention and control, to instead consider it in light of self-regulation and agency, populist discourse, power and the broader operation of policing and government policy;  contemporary challenges in policing, including responding to new technologies and offences, such as stalking, cybercrime and sexting, as well as challenges arising in relation to police misconduct and corruption, the use of deadly force, and accountability; and  policing of diversity, in which we examine policing and control in the context of marginalised groups, including, but not limited to LGBTI, young people, Indigenous Australians and asylum seekers.","enjoyResponse":120,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2458","eftsl":0.125}
