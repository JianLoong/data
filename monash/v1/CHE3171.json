The design, operation and economic issues surrounding large-scale biomolecular process equipment including bioreactors, filtration systems, chromatographic columns, sterilisation and aseptic operation, auxiliary equipment and the associated control systems will be considered. The wider biotechnology environment will be considered especially with regards to GxP, national and international regulatory bodies, biosafety and commercialisation.","enjoyResponse":70,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"CHE3171","eftsl":0.125}
