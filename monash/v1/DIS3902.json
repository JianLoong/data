It builds sequentially upon the skills and knowledge of 3D design and imaging by providing an opportunity to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the methods and theories of generating synthetic images. Emphasis is placed upon students developing their creative skills through a combination of directed and self-directed practice. The unit offers students the opportunity to investigate issues of modelling, space and animation, specific to their proposed projects.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"DIS3902","eftsl":0.125}
