It aims to provide the foundation for advanced design research skills and a capacity for critical thinking appropriate to honours and further postgraduate levels.The unit examines a number of methodological approaches to design research, from the analytical to the phenomenological, the discursive and the poetic. The complex intersection between studio research and conventional research will also be explored. In doing so students will be able to evaluate their own practice and position it within a broader framework of geographic, historical, political, economic and social contexts. The unit will expose students to the diverse techniques utilized in information gathering and will emphasize the efficient management of bibliographic resources. More advanced writing skills will be developed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"TDN3003","eftsl":0.125}
