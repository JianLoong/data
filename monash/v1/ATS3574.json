Beginning with European and American witchcraft, it examines key shifts in ideas about the origins of criminality and \u0027criminal defects\u0027; changing regimes of punishment and incarceration; the history of disease, disability, \u0027lunacy\u0027 and \u0027freaks\u0027; panics over juvenile delinquency; and the history of monstrosity from Frankenstein to space aliens and serial killers. It will explore the role of fears and fantasies in the development of structures of power and authority, deviance as a focus for political mobilisation, and the connections and differences between deviance, transgression and resistance.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3574","eftsl":0.125}
