Violent conflict has been a feature of human society for millennia. Today, we are arguably living in a period unprecedented global peace, but there are still numerous countries and regions that are plagued by ongoing conflicts. These range from civil conflicts in Africa, to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, the \"war on terror\" in the Middle-East, and other low-intensity and unconventional conflicts throughout the world. In addition, the emergence of China as a nascent military superpower, combined with the relative decline of the United States, has raised fears of a \u0027hegemonic transition\u0027: a delicate period that, in previous historical periods, has often been accompanied by intense security competition and war. This course will equip Monash students with the theoretical and practical knowledge to understand these issues, which rank as being among the important problems in politics.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3015","eftsl":0.125}
