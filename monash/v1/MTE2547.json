Students will apply mathematical techniques to solve problems in various materials engineering fields. Examples of mechanical and electrical properties of materials are examined by the application of matrix operations. Heat transfer and diffusion in materials processing are used as exemplars of partial differential equations and boundary value problems. The error function is introduced. Finite difference methods are explored in relation to heat transfer and diffusion problems, basic curve fitting is introduced as a way of modelling a material\u0027s response to deformation. The statistical treatment of experimental data is presented.  The distribution of errors for discrete and continuous data are analysed via the Binomial, Poisson and Normal distributions.  Statistical testing and fitting of data and various forms of least square fitting of data is introduced.  The applicability of non-parametric statistics is applied to a range of non-ordinal data. Problems are analysed using Excel and Matlab.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE2547","eftsl":0.125}
