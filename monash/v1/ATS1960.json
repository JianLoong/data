The historical relationship between these three religious or ethnic groups has sparked considered historical debate and popular misunderstanding. This unit will unpack some of these common assumptions by tracing the evolving relationship between Christians, Muslims, and Jews across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The unit will begin by tracing Enlightenment debates about tolerance and difference that centred around the place of the Jews in modern European nation-states.  It will then shift to discussing the social and economic positions of Jews and Muslims in 19th century North Africa, as well as the socio-economic mobility of Jews in 19th century Europe. It will finally move into the twentieth century and cover topics including the emergence of Zionism, the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel, decolonization and the emigration of North African Jews and Muslims to Europe, and contemporary debates about difference in 21st century Europe.","enjoyResponse":21,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS1960","eftsl":0.125}
