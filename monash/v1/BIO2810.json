Students will gain an understanding of how populations of animals and plants survive and interact in tropical environments. The unit covers fundamental ecological theories and concepts such as biodiversity, population growth, predation, competition, succession, mutualism, nutrient cycling and disturbance. Consideration will be given to how many of these processes operate differently between tropical and temperate climates. Students will learn how ecological theory can be applied in the management and conservation of tropical environments. The practical component comprises group field projects in tropical rainforests such as a mangrove forest and a dipterocarp forest.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO2810","eftsl":0.125}
