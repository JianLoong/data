In a liberal democracy like Australia, its role and function have profound implications for the conduct of politics, the nature of democracy and public policy outcomes. In this unit, the relationship between the media, politics and public policy is studied from three broad perspectives. First, the politics of the media is investigated from the perspective of liberal democratic theory in order to understand the role of news media on the policy debate. Second, the political economy of the media is investigated. Particular emphasis is on the structure and operation of media organisations and journalists and how political news is covered. Third, the unit undertakes a study of the relationship between the media and political actors. Particular emphasis is on the use of public relations and \u0027spin doctors\u0027 in managing the media as well as the utilisation of political advertising and strategic political communication by governments and political agents.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"APG5180","eftsl":0.125}
