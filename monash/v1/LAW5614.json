The unit is designed to challenge students about notions of families and relationships. It looks at \u0027traditional\u0027 marriages as well as same sex marriages and de facto relationships in different jurisdictions. It looks at families formed through assisted reproductive technology, adoption and surrogacy. Once legislators intervene, courts need to interpret statutory frameworks in light of cultural values and social science knowledge. Students will examine how culture and social science influence legislation and case law. Students will also examine the notion of \u0027best interests\u0027 of the child and how this is determined in Australia and other jurisdictions.This unit also challenges students to consider what constitutes child abuse and neglect. Students also examine emerging international issues such as international adoption, commercial surrogacy and international abduction of children.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5614","eftsl":0.125}
