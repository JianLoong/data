Students will be introduced to environmental, food, forensic, clinical and occupational toxicology. This unit presents the broad science of toxicology to facilitate the understanding of the principles and mechanisms of the action of poisons on specific organ systems. It examines the response of each body system to poisons and the specific effects of a wide range of toxic agents - from pesticides to radiation. In addition sources of toxins, toxicokinetics, toxicity testing and risk assessment are studied to enable students to understand how to predict and eliminate the potential risk of toxicity to humans and animals. The topics taught include general principles of toxicology, dispositions of toxicants, non-organ-directed toxicology, target organ toxicity, toxic agents, environmental toxicology and applications of toxicology.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"PHA3800","eftsl":0.125}
