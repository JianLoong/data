The mass electronic media of cinema, television, and the Internet have sped up the transnational flow of images of modernity and created local desires to consume cultures originating in distant places. This unit looks at the implications of globalisation for a variety of cultural phenomena, tracing transitions from local to global cultural practices. It looks at specific cases of local consumption of global cultures, including television, video games, popular music, fiction and comics, and the Internet.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3627","eftsl":0.125}
