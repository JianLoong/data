It will cover the problems that prevent raw data from being effectively used in analysis and the data cleansing and pre-processing tasks that prepare it for analytics. These include, for example, the handling of bad and missing data, data integration and initial feature selection. It will also introduce text mining and web analytics. Python and the Pandas environment will be used for implementation.","enjoyResponse":35,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT5196","eftsl":0.125}
