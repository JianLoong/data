They will discover the diversity of microorganisms from viruses to bacteria to eukaryotes. They will learn their ecological role, their importance to the medical and food industry and how to identify, cultivate and control them. They will also gain an understanding of how microorganisms evolve and gain antibiotic resistance. The practical classes will introduce basic concepts such as aseptic techniques, staining and microscopy, isolation and enumeration of bacteria as well as control of microorganisms. Furthermore, students will be given the opportunity to explore the tropical environment and sample the air, water and soil samples as well as local food outlets. Thus they will develop a better understanding of the diversity of the microbial world. This unit will be the foundation to other third-year level microbiology units such as food, environmental and medical microbiology.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BTH2830","eftsl":0.125}
