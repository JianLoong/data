Many protocols used in the application, transport, and network layers are examined and analysed. Client-server and peer-to-peer application architectures and their features are compared and contrasted. Reliable communication over an unreliable network layer, connection establishment and teardown, and multiplexing issues are covered. Protocols for network security, techniques for providing confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation and message integrity are also studied. Finally, protocols used for network management are analysed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4044","eftsl":0.125}
