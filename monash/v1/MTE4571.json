It engenders an appreciation of the role and responsibility of the engineer in management of risk - be it economic or personal (through design, manufacturing and use). The role of materials identification and selection and the impact on function and environment is covered. In addition it looks at the role computers play in all facets of the current engineering environment, including the key areas of design, analysis, machining and robotics. It seeks to give students practical skills in these areas, in particular in the area of computer-aided drafting.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4571","eftsl":0.125}
