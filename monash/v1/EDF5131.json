Students develop an understanding of key theoretical and pedagogical perspectives and issues in the teaching of economics and related curriculum. Through an examination of a range of curricula drawn from state (e.g. VCE economics), national (e.g. Australian Curriculum: economics and business) and international contexts (e.g. IB economics), students are familiarised with current developments in the theory, research and practice of economics education. Students work independently, collaboratively and interdependently to develop their capabilities in planning and implementing appropriate curriculum and pedagogy. They learn how teachers plan for and undertake educational projects and research as part of their professional work. The unit reinforces a view of learning about teaching as an ongoing, collaborative process that is developed through critical reflection on experience.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5131","eftsl":0.125}
