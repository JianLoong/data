It will consider the obligations that relevant international treaties and conventions impose on member states in the design of their patent laws. Within the context of this international structure, it will immerse students in understanding and critically analyzing the approaches taken to patentable subject matter by Canada, the US, the UK and Australia. In particular, it will focus on the challenges posed to patent law by new and emerging technologies in such areas as business methods and systems, software, higher life forms, methods of medical and surgical treatment and genetic materials. No technical background required or expected, nor is any previous work in patent law needed.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4655","eftsl":0.125}
