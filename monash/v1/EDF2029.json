Students explore what young people need to learn and be able to do in order to become active and informed citizens in Australia and globally, including how communities function, how civic processes work and how they can participate in community activities. They examine exemplars of how theme-based or integrated learning is used in primary schools to develop children\u0027s knowledge, understanding and capacities to be involved in citizenship activities, including as part of the formal school curriculum, in wider whole-school programs and with links to community.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2029","eftsl":0.125}
