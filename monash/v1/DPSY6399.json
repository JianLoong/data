At this stage of their training students will be expected to carry a client load with minimal supervisory support. The location of the specialised practicum will be negotiated with individual students, taking into account their preferences and their need for specialised skill acquisition, but options include forensic settings, child and adolescent mental health services, psychiatry units of private and public hospitals, and specialised health services.  The aim of the Specialised Clinical Practicum is for students to gain proficiency in their clinical psychology skills or to consolidate skills in specialist areas.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"DPSY6399","eftsl":0}
