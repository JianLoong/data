In this lab, students will explore a broad range of mobile-based and identity-based interactive prototyping techniques from Android and iOS applications to RFID, and will discuss the significance and complexity of contextualisation required in systemic approaches in the prototype creation process. Skills developed in this unit will be used to support the studio research project to bring abstract concepts into the real world.","enjoyResponse":10,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"MDC5215","eftsl":0.125}
