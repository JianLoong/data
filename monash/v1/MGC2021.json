At the heart of such debates is how organisations influence and in turn are influenced by the socio-cultural contexts in which they are situated. In this unit we will begin by introducing a framework for conceptualising the organisational/socio-cultural interface and exploring how this impacts those who are situated in and around organisations. We will then focus on specific themes common to contemporary modes of working where organisational dynamics and socio-cultural expectations or beliefs come together. By the end of the unit, students will be able to articulate and apply contemporary theories of organising to a range of ethical, social and cultural challenges that coalesce in and around today\u0027s organisations.","enjoyResponse":18,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MGC2021","eftsl":0.125}
