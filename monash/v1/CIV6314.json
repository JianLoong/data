The concept of sustainable transport is introduced along with the steps in the transport planning process. Supply and demand oriented approaches to addressing transport challenges are reviewed and travel demand management is placed into context. The characteristics of transport modes and travel demand patterns are used to provide a framework for considering the suitability of a particular transport mode for a particular context.
