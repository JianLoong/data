It addresses learner diversity as an approach to achieve participation of all learners. Students explore and critically evaluate theories of diversity alongside the historical and contemporary experiences of cultural, linguistic and socially diverse minority groups. As students develop their understanding of planning, goal setting and design to improve learning engagement, they consider how digital technologies may promote inclusion in the learning environment. Key policy and legislative requirements which encourage attention to diversity, inclusion and participation are examined. In these ways, students build knowledge of a repertoire of positive teaching and learning practices to manage classrooms and/or student behaviour within differentiated learning educational settings and among students with additional needs. They evaluate and apply these to develop their skills in supporting inclusive learning across contexts and students.","enjoyResponse":114,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5016","eftsl":0.125}
