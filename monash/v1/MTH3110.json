The major focus is on the various concepts of curvature and related notions, and the relationships between them. Curvature and torsion of a curve.  First and second fundamental forms of a surface. Geodesic and normal curvatures of a curve on a surface. Gaussian, mean and principal curvatures of a surface. Important theorems relating these concepts. Links will be drawn with many other areas of mathematics, including real and complex analysis, linear algebra, differential equations, and general relativity.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MTH3110","eftsl":0.125}
