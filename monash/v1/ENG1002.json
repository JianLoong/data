Theory underpinning analogue and digital circuit design; energy and mass balance; materials processing and the role of functional materials will be presented. The contribution of each topic to a contemporary engineering application will be demonstrated.Team based projects will highlight the multidisciplinary nature of modern engineering. These concepts will be practiced through hands-on projects carried out by teams. Communication and teamwork skills will be developed through teamwork tasks.","enjoyResponse":305,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENG1002","eftsl":0.125}
