It will examine the theoretical underpinnings of many areas of human rights, such as free speech, privacy and political rights. To do so it will compare different traditions of Western thought that continue to influence our views on liberty. The course is based upon close readings of selected politico-legal philosophers, for example John Stuart Mill\u0027s \"On Liberty\", which argues for freedom of speech and action to the extent that this freedom is consistent with not harming others. Liberal and republican views of political freedom are contrasted, along with Kant\u0027s analysis that provides the theoretical underpinning of many arguments for human rights. While the course is structured around an examination of primary philosophical readings, the theoretical frameworks will be considered in the context of contemporary legal debates and concepts.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5609","eftsl":0.125}
