In doing so, it builds on the principles of group accounting introduced in AFS2740/ACS2740. The unit explores: factors to be considered when assessing control of one entity by another; accounting for business combinations, acquisition of equity interests in another entity, wholly or partly, at acquisition and subsequent to acquisition; accounting for intragroup transactions and dividends, at-acquisition fair value adjustments, preference shares and impairment of goodwill. Consolidation is also applied to accounting for complex groups and interim acquisitions. The unit also covers the application of IFRS to accounting for associates and joint arrangements. In preparation of group accounts, the unit requires the appropriate application of IFRS topics (as covered in AFS3730/ACS3730) in the group financial statements.","enjoyResponse":16,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"ACS3740","eftsl":0.125}
