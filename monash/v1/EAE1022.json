This unit looks at the forces and processes that have shaped the planet over time, and the fossils and other biological, chemical and physical factors that provide evidence that these changes. Earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, tornadoes, cyclones and other high impact events shape the very nature of life on Earth. We look at the science that we use to understand and model these hazards, and our attempts to predict and minimize the adverse effects of these processes and events. We will study the natural resources that are required to maintain our society - minerals, energy, water, soils and food - their origin, use, and limits, and sustainable management. At the completion of this unit, students will have a clear understanding of society\u0027s impact on the biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and atmosphere.","enjoyResponse":116,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"EAE1022","eftsl":0.125}
