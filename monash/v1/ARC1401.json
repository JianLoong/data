Visual and spatial language are analysed in relation to technical, aesthetic, and ideological frameworks. The reasons behind stylistic development are sought within the framework of the history of ideas, from the political and social to the economic. Diverse forms of art, architecture and design are analysed to offer an appreciation for the connections between cultural production and larger processes of change. In tutorials students are given opportunities to develop visual and verbal skills for engaging in contemporary discourse on art, architecture and design.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"ARC1401","eftsl":0.125}
