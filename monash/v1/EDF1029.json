It develops students\u0027 knowledge and understanding of differentiation for all ability levels, particularly in relation to children with special needs due to disability. Students are introduced to policies, legislation and research influencing schooling and classroom practices for children with special needs. They engage with theoretical perspectives and research relating to difference and disability and consider the implications for themselves, learners and families. They investigate several common approaches to the education of children with special needs including inclusive education, differentiated instruction, universal design for learning and personalised learning. They also learn how environments, curricula and pedagogies can be designed and modified to support learners\u0027 diverse needs. Students develop an understanding of the necessity of positive relationships with children and the value of partnering constructively with families and support staff to work towards educational equity and enhancing the learning outcomes of children with special learning needs in primary classrooms.","enjoyResponse":23,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF1029","eftsl":0.125}
