In almost all structural applications the principle loads are carried by engineering alloys. The reasons underlying this choice are discussed and the general methodology used to choose a material for use in a new application is presented. The link between processing, microstructure and properties is emphasized. A selection of engineering alloys, including steels (carbon, alloy, stainless, dual phase, TRIP/TWIP), cast irons, aluminium, magnesium, titanium, nickel and cobalt-based superalloys and zirconium alloys, is discussed. The state-of-the-art approaches to the design and development of new alloys for the 21st century are outlined.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4594","eftsl":0.125}
