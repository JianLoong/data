The seminars involve discussion and simulations. The lecturer will provide background lecturing and information on key areas, but the essence of the unit is student centred learning. Students will be broken into groups to undertake the research, engage in discussions and report back to the seminar as they would in legal practice when assisting an employer in an activity such as this.The lecturer will provide feedback on presentations (which would provide ongoing and regular formative assessment), and direct the research and thinking for the next stage of the project.While the pedagogical approach to the unit will remain constant, the actual problem to be used will vary in each year. The problem may be primarily commercial or non-commercial although it could equally combine elements of each. Students will be advised of the content of the problem prior to enrolment.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4228","eftsl":0.125}
