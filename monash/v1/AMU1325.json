Through lectures, class discussion and written work, students will explore how rivalry and conflict between states and peoples in the twentieth century have been closely intertwined with the rise of ideologies such as imperialism, nationalism, communism, liberal democracy and religious ideas. A close reading of particular events as they unfolded in selected parts of the world demonstrate also how external developments and local factors interact to shape local as well as international dynamics, with implications also for current world affairs.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AMU1325","eftsl":0.125}
