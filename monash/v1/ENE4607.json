A critical aspect of this unit will be class discussions, where participation in broad ranging debate will be actively encouraged for all students. Communication skills are critical for environmental issues in engineering, as there are commonly differences of opinion with regards to environmental risks as well as their respective solutions. This unit seeks to unify environmental risk assessment in an engineering context.","enjoyResponse":12,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ENE4607","eftsl":0.125}
