The subject concentrates on a number of key texts from the Symbolist and Modernist periods and examines various works which may be seen to exemplify, modify, or challenge these poetics. Students will be required to reflect both creatively and analytically on their own writing practice in the light of these texts. In the collaborative environment of workshops, students will be encouraged to experiment with a range of Modernist techniques including: free verse, parataxis, the ideogramic method, automatic writing, visual and sound poetry.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2508","eftsl":0.125}
