It analyses voltage and current source inverters operating under open and closed loop regulation, develops advanced models of AC motors, and then integrates these concepts into variable speed drives for AC motors. A similar approach is used for DC motor drive systems, first using multipulse SCR converters and then hard switched converters for more advanced systems based on brushless DC and stepper servo motors. Finally, topologies such as cycloconverters, matrix converters and multilevel converters are presented, together with typical applications.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"ECE4054","eftsl":0.125}
