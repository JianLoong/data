Students will be able to define radiation and radioactive decay. Students will be able to describe in detail the interactions of radiation with matter, and explain how radiation is detected and measured. Students will gain an appreciation for the importance of radiation safety, and will be encouraged to critically reflect on the implications of radiation protection in their clinical experiences. Students will also be given an introduction to medical radiations instrumentation and techniques, with emphasis on the fusion of the conceptual theory with the practical applications. Whilst studying these topics, students will be encouraged to critically reflect, analyse and synthesise relevant information from the literature and their previous experiences of studying physics.","enjoyResponse":14,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"RTS4101","eftsl":0.125}
