We deal with the trophic structure of marine ecosystems, including primary and secondary production, microbial loops, food webs and their importance for marine fisheries. The implications of the characteristic life cycles of marine organisms to their geographical distribution are also considered. These topics are placed in the context of specific marine ecosystems including coastal habitats, coral reefs, open oceans, the deep sea and polar ecosystems. The practical component comprises a field trip (fee payable) either to Heron Island in December or the Queenscliff Marine Station in February where students work in small groups on specific aspects of marine biology.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO3021","eftsl":0.125}
