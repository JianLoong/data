Students gain a strong understanding of how learning occurs by examining research into effective learning models. Reflecting on personal learning experiences, both past and present, is a powerful way for individuals to examine learning; it demonstrates how cultural and socio-economic contexts influence learning. This includes consideration of the benefits and limitations of employing digital technologies as a means to engage learners and address the challenges of achieving student-centred participation and inclusion. Students consider approaches to measure and evaluate learning and appreciate how a focus on learning prepares them as stronger and more responsive teachers.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4120","eftsl":0.125}
