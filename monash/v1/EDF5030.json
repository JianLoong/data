The unit focuses on how science knowledge shifts and changes over time and through technological and social change. The unit adopts a constructivist perspective by exploring strategies that include the use of prior knowledge, questioning and inquiry learning. An emphasis is placed upon hands-on approaches, scientific investigations and student-owned/student-centred investigations. The relationship between science, technology and society, different science curriculum and the nature of science as a discipline is also considered. Students build understanding of science learning and teaching through collaborative participation in a range of contexts and critically reflect on these.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5030","eftsl":0.125}
