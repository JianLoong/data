One piece of assessment will be developed and completed by the student for this unit. The nature and content of the assessment itself may vary from student to student depending upon their area of interest, the skill area they wish to develop and, in some cases, the requirements of their work organisation. Topics could include small research projects such as evaluations of particular health and welfare programs, pilot studies, literature reviews, or the learning and implementation of particular social work approaches or theories. The research study or project generally takes the form of an academic project or an advanced practicum project.  The focus may be on any field in which social workers are employed, dependant on staff availability to supervise.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"SWM5170","eftsl":0.25}
