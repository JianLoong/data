The course is laboratory based with tutorials to ensure a thorough theoretical understanding of techniques. Topics include the anatomy of the immune system, production of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies, structure and properties of immunoglobulins (antibodies), electrophoresis and other techniques for detection of antigen/antibody reactions. Diagnostic immunology techniques include immunofluorescence, fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and analysis of plasma proteins (immunoglobulins, complement etc).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"IMM3051","eftsl":0.125}
