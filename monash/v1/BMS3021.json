The disease mechanisms mediated by genetic disorders resulting in  abnormalities in protein folding, protein trafficking and gain or loss of protein function  will be presented. State of the art developments in molecular medicine including transgenic models of human disease, gene therapy, and recent developments in transplantation will be highlighted. Specific biotechnologies to be discussed include production of recombinant proteins, antibody engineering and gene editing approaches.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BMS3021","eftsl":0.125}
