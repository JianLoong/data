A variety of paradigms for developing self- and other-awareness are introduced to empower developing leaders to begin their personal inner growth trajectory. Instruments and practices, learning styles and personality profile instruments are used, along with a rigorous reflective practice regimen, to help students develop a personal development plan. Students engage with other aspiring and practising leaders in a process of personal and professional growth through collaborative reflection to become aware of their cognitive and emotional meaning-making. This knowledge is used to understand how to lead and engage others in ways that produce robust, sustainable organisations.","enjoyResponse":2,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5637","eftsl":0.25}
