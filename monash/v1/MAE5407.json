Students will learn to translate real-world loading into engineering models using variational methods and minimum potential energy techniques and develop an understanding of the application of a range of finite elements and mesh generation techniques. An understanding of the choice of appropriate elements, aspect ratio, distortion limitations and reduced integration techniques will be sought. Skills in the use of commercial finite element codes, such as NASTRAN, currently used in the aerospace industry will complete the unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5407","eftsl":0.125}
