It examines artistic forms and media in the light of how they are made and how they engage with social symbols. Visual language is analysed in relation to aesthetic, technical and ideological frameworks. The reasons behind stylistic development are sought within the framework of the history of ideas, from the political and cultural to the economic. The unit crucially examines relations between art and design; and the diverse themes in contemporary practice are chosen in order to highlight the dynamic links between different media.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"TAD1101","eftsl":0.125}
