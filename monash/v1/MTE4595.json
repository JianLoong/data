The mechanisms of corrosion in some environments will also be studies. This includes stress corrosion cracking, microbiologically induced corrosion and corrosion in reinforced concrete structures.Corrosion mitigation mechanisms will be discussed. This includes materials selection, cathodic protection, coatings and inhibitors. The unit will also cover cement and concrete, including reinforced concrete and topics related to durability of non-metals.","enjoyResponse":6,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4595","eftsl":0.125}
