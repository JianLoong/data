It provides students with a coherent and unified framework for the mathematical modelling, analysis and control of space vehicles. The focus will be on the physical phenomena and analytical procedures required to understand and predict the behaviour of orbiting spacecraft. The students will see and appreciate how these methods are applied to real space systems and why spaceflight dynamics is a crucial tool in the development of any type of space mission.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MAE5408","eftsl":0.125}
