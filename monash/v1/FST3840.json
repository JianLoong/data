This unit introduces students to food processing principles that group physical food processes into basic unit operations such as fluid flow, heat transfer, drying, evaporation, contact equilibrium processes, mechanical separations, size reduction and mixing. After this, the unit expands on various processing techniques that transform raw materials into foods that are safe (chemically and microbiologically), nutritious, convenient and attractive to consumers. Students will gain a theoretical and practical understanding of the techniques used in the processing of various food groups.  Students will be familiar with the physical processes and equipment used in processing of various food groups, and the regulation of food industry products and practices.","enjoyResponse":34,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"FST3840","eftsl":0.125}
