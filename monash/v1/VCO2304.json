The course comprises a series of theoretical and practical exercises. Students are encouraged to build upon their skills and knowledge of typography and begin to critically analyse and question the relationships between type and meaning, type and language. Emphasis is placed upon conceptual development and a willingness to approach typography perceptively and with curiosity. Students are encouraged to pursue individual outcomes to projects that indicate a willingness to explore and experiment within an awareness of the history of typography.
