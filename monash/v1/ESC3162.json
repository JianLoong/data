An understanding of ore deposit genesis is developed via an Earth Systems approach. The tectonic settings of ore deposits are considered within the context of the plate tectonic paradigm, and global metallogenic events throughout Earth\u0027s history. This includes a brief introduction to the minerals industry, including mining and exploration practices. Practical classes will examine sample sets from around the world and focus on developing and understanding of ore deposit genesis, and on developing skills suitable for the minerals industry. Fieldwork consists of an excursion to examine the ore deposits of Victoria.","enjoyResponse":13,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"ESC3162","eftsl":0.125}
