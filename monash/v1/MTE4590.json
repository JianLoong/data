The reasons for using modelling approaches are discussed and the different types of models available are outlined. For each of the length scales important in understanding material behaviour (nano-, micro-, meso- and macro-), the available modelling techniques are outlined and their principles, methods of implementation, advantages, disadvantages and perceived future developments are discussed. Examples of modelling approaches will be selected from all classes of materials. The general methodology used for constructing models is emphasised.","enjoyResponse":5,"faculty":"Faculty of Engineering","unitCode":"MTE4590","eftsl":0.125}
