It helps to communicate value and create and deliver that value. Branding is a promise of value for customers. It helps to attract and, if it is true and accurate, keep customers. It provides an extra element of understanding or meaning, for customers as they form opinions and make purchase decisions from a variety of competing offerings. There is strong industry demand for graduates with a thorough understanding of branding. While this unit is primarily for students undertaking a major in marketing it is offered to any student with a prerequisite of an introductory marketing unit.","enjoyResponse":17,"faculty":"Faculty of Business and Economics","unitCode":"MKB2521","eftsl":0.125}
