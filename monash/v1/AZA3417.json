The title Africa and Its Others can be interpreted in different ways: Africa and its different discoverers/- explorers, Africa and its colonizers, Africa and its diasporas, Africa and its travellers, Africa and its other self and so on. This unit will thus look at how Africa has been and is represented from the outside by outsiders and insiders and from the inside by insiders/outsiders through a variety of materials and various perspectives (literary, anthropological, historical and philosophical).","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3417","eftsl":0.125}
