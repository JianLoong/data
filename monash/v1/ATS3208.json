It will include a field trip to Vietnam and Indonesia, and explore the site of the former refugee camp of Pulau Galang in Indonesia. Galang is a site of pilgrimage for survivors and the only former refugee camp to have been preserved. A series of lectures and seminars will introduce students to the experiences of Vietnamese refugees, and students will be able to reflect on the refugees\u0027 journeys, their resettlement experiences in Australia, and the nature of remembrance.","enjoyResponse":19,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3208","eftsl":0.25}
