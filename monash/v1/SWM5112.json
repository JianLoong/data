Research is a powerful intervention tool through which change can be achieved with individuals, groups and communities. This unit is offered as part of the core requirements of the professional association, the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). Social work research is seen to be informed by a clear value base and driven to deliver socially constructive outcomes. The unit will explore research processes, presenting a structured approach to the implementation of a research proposal. There will be particular emphasis on research in practice, program evaluation,  and program development, as well as the ethical underpinnings of all research. The overall aim of this unit is to encourage students to become critically reflective, research minded practitioners, who contribute in an ongoing way to the knowledge base of the profession. Students will engage in a range of learning activities, including interactive lectures, workshops, cross-disciplinary masterclasses and integrated online learning. Students will focus on learning the language and terminology of research, within a reflective practice framework.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"SWM5112","eftsl":0.25}
