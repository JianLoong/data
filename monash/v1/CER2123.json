Continued research and investigation of materials and processes fosters the acquisition of technical language, and influences appropriate choices to realise concepts within the context of a developing personal visual language. The emphasis is more on self-motivated approaches than on set projects. Teaching methods therefore tend to concentrate on individual tuition and group critique. This unit continues to focus on the nexus between art making and the cultural and social contexts of art.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"CER2123","eftsl":0.125}
