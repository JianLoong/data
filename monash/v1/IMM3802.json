It reviews the normal immune response to foreign antigens and how it provides defence against micro-organisms, and also the pathogenesis and diagnosis of disorders associated with an excessive, defective or unwarranted immune response. Disorders discussed include autoimmune diseases, allergies, immunodeficiency states, leukaemia/ lymphoma and transplants. Students will also be introduced to the practical aspects of laboratory immunology. Techniques used in clinical and research immunology laboratories will be presented during practical classes.","enjoyResponse":40,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"IMM3802","eftsl":0.125}
