Topics covered include properties of real numbers (infima/suprema and the axiom of completeness), sequences and series of real numbers (order limit theorem, Cauchy sequences and completeness, compactness), properties of functions over the reals (intermediate value theorem, mean value theorem), sequences and series of functions (pointwise and uniform convergence, the Weierstrass M-test, continuity and differentiability of the limit). Emphasis will be on rigorous mathematical proof and examples will be provided to show how intuition can be misleading.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"MTH2140","eftsl":0.125}
