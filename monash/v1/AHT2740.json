Topics examined will be the First Fleet artists, the work of John Glover, the Heidelberg School, Australian modernism, post-War Australian landscape, the work of Albert Namatjira and Margaret Preston and the work of a number of contemporary Australian artists, including Gordon Bennett and Tracey Moffatt. The course will ask questions concerning the \"Australianness\" of Australian art and whether we can write a new history of Australian art appropriate to contemporary conditions.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture","unitCode":"AHT2740","eftsl":0.125}
