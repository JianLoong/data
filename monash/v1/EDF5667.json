PBS is a framework of practices that help improve the social and learning behaviours of students and decrease disruptions that interfere with instruction in educational settings and communities. The unit examines the wide-ranging research supporting PBS for learners of all age groups including preschool, primary, and secondary school students, and for students with severe emotional behaviours and those with developmental disabilities. Students critically review strategies for designing school-wide/system-wide PBS programs based on evidence and are supported to develop their own PBS strategies that can be used to prevent and/or respond to challenging behaviours in their educational contexts. Consideration is given to the work of leading and sustaining PBS strategies and practices across schools and systems.","enjoyResponse":4,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5667","eftsl":0.25}
