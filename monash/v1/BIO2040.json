Recent losses of biota have been caused by habitat loss and degradation, climate change and pollution, the introduction of exotic species and overexploitation of natural resources. Science-based conservation measures are explored that may reduce loss of biodiversity/ecosystem function, including habitat preservation and restoration, combating climate change, and intensive conservation of species.  We analyse how conservation efforts may involve trade-offs with biological, economic, social and political factors.","enjoyResponse":59,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"BIO2040","eftsl":0.125}
