Informed by an understanding of the fundamental role of climate stability for sustained population health, and of evidence for anthropogenic global warming, the focus of the unit will be on direct and indirect mechanisms through which climate change could impact on health, including extreme weather events, changing patterns of vector-borne disease, water-borne infections, food quality and availability, air quality, and social disruption. There will be an emphasis on evidence for past and predicted health effects, health burden magnitude and distribution, and the complex interplay between population and environmental factors that influence vulnerability. Students will apply this knowledge to critically appraise adaptation and mitigation initiatives from a public health perspective, and will be expected to engage with current climate change issues and communicate their ideas clearly and effectively.","enjoyResponse":8,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"MPH5042","eftsl":0.125}
