Students will be introduced to advanced techniques for character detailing (modelling and texturing) character animation (motion capture systems) and 3D environmental design. The theoretical and practical considerations contributing to the conceptualisation and preparation of 3D characters for animation sequences will constitute a key focus of this unit.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Information Technology","unitCode":"FIT2087","eftsl":0.125}
