Additionally, this unit will provide an understanding of theoretical concepts and formulation principles of semi-solids, aerosols, sprays and foams, and modified release products.This will involve the study of: effect of drug metabolism and drug transporters on pharmacokinetics pharmacokinetics in preganancy, paediatrics and geriatrics hepatic and renal clearance and plasma protein building impact of hepatic/ renal diseases, haemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis on drug therapy drug-drug interactions pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship pharmacokinetic dose individualisation therapeutic drug monitoring formulation principles of semi-solids and aerosol systems modified release dosage form design","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PAC3241","eftsl":0.125}
