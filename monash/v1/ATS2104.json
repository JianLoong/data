In this unit students will explore a number of important early ethnographic texts written about Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders to learn more about the historical portrayal of Indigenous people and communities. Instead of seeing these texts of little value due to the nature of their writing and colonial stances, students will interrogate a selection of key texts to understand why and how they are still of value to contemporary Indigenous peoples while also examining the moral and ethical dilemmas posed through their contemporary use.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS2104","eftsl":0.125}
