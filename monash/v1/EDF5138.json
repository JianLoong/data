It provides students with the opportunity to develop their planning and teaching skills and emphasises the importance of reflection and continual development of teaching practice. This unit draws on concepts from constructivist theories of learning, pedagogical content knowledge and critical reflection, enabling pre-service teachers to apply evidence-based teaching approaches that successfully facilitate student learning. Students build understanding that learning and teaching science is more about creating a scientifically literate community than it is about content and correct answers. Pre-service teachers are assisted to trial and critique a wide variety of purposeful and effective teaching strategies including the implementation of  information and communication technology (ICT) skills and techniques considered essential for establishing a productive, diverse and sustainable secondary classroom. The unit emphasises a view of learning about teaching as an ongoing, collaborative process that is developed through engaging with theory, research and critical reflection on experience.","enjoyResponse":7,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF5138","eftsl":0.125}
