They further develop their capacity to plan for differentiated learning for students across the full range of abilities, meet diverse learners\u0027 needs, and choose varied forms of behaviour management. Students explore a range of theoretical perspectives on the pedagogical practices of teachers. Students are encouraged to research multiple examples of teaching and learning practices, critically reflect on their own teaching practices and those of others, and develop a robust theoretical and practical perspective on the profession and their own classroom practice that is demonstrated through individual, group and peer written and oral presentations.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF2211","eftsl":0.125}
