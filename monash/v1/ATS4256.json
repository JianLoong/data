This subject analyses the development of Egyptian culture attempting to document the processes which culminated in Unification. It will examine Egypt\u0027s links with the neighbouring regions to determine spheres of influence and impact. In the process it will explore modern theories of the emergence of complex society as they relate to Egypt, the impact of environmental change on this development and the techniques used to explore non-literate societies.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4256","eftsl":0.25}
