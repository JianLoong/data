Whole body systems will be considered, and examples of disease states which are amenable to pharmacotherapy will be discussed in detail. The subject aims to provide an overview of the functions of the respiratory, digestive and urinogenital systems; an equal emphasis will be placed on one of the key components of drug discovery and the choice of therapeutic target based on a thorough understanding of the disease process.This will involve the study of: special senses respiratory system urogenital system digestive system focus on disease.","enjoyResponse":60,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC1012","eftsl":0.125}
