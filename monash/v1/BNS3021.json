It addresses the nature of neuronal communication and how neurotransmitters interact with receptors to send signals to other brain cells. Emphasis will be placed on the regulation of homeostasis and behaviour by neurochemicals and hormones. The role of glial cells in controlling key metabolic pathways in the brain will also be reviewed. Lastly, this unit will examine how synaptic plasticity and biochemical changes underpin memory formation.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences","unitCode":"BNS3021","eftsl":0.125}
