Students explore how the humanities and social sciences (HASS) are represented in national and local curriculum and how the learning area is taught in various ways throughout the primary and secondary years. They engage with theoretical, philosophical, pedagogical viewpoints and assessment strategies that address issues deriving from the relevant curriculum frameworks, including the cross-curriculum priorities. Students also learn and develop the skills of lesson planning and implementation of curriculum in the learning area through single-disciplinary and/or integrated studies, using inquiry methodology.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Education","unitCode":"EDF4253","eftsl":0.125}
