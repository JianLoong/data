This unit aims to build on PSC1031 Physical Chemistry I to provide students with a firm understanding of the physical chemistry that underpins the properties and dissolution of pharmaceutical solids and additives to form solutions. In particular an understanding of the physicochemical properties of pharmaceutical solids (drugs and excipients), their transfer into solution form and properties of those solutions from a pharmaceutical science perspective will set the foundation for students to understand the impact of these properties and concepts in pharmaceutical and other formulated products. The key concepts are related directly to aspects of a suite of representative pharmaceutical products allowing the students to put the concepts into a relevant context. The understanding of these principles will also assist students in their understanding in some areas of chemistry, physiology and biology.This will involve: physical chemistry of solutions solids, semisolids and solubility interfacially active molecules and their use in formulation acid-base functional groups","enjoyResponse":61,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC1032","eftsl":0.125}
