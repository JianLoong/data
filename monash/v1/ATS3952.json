This unit focuses on the history of textile production from the vantage point of the Prato campus, which is situated in the centre of textile production in Italy. The unit examines the role of textiles in the world through a number of themes and across centuries, from early silk trade caravans to the present day, focussing especially on industrialisation and imperialism, trade and cultural exchange, globalisation and localisation, and labour-related migration across the world. With its narrow focus on the material itself, and its location in one of the world centres of its production, the unit allows students to reflect on the historical and cultural ramifications of industrialisation and trade.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3952","eftsl":0.25}
