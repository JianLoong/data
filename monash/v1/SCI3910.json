Each student is required to research, develop, manage and deliver (teach) a science based module that matches the learning outcomes specified to them by their client (supervising teacher). Prior to their school placement, students participate in a series of workshops on: understanding and catering for different learning styles, motivation, team work, goal setting, planning, management, leadership, effective communication and presentation skills, asking the right questions and reflection. While there is an emphasis on how the students can directly apply this knowledge in the short term (during their school placements), they are also required to reflect  how they will transfer this learning into their future workplaces.","enjoyResponse":30,"faculty":"Faculty of Science","unitCode":"SCI3910","eftsl":0.125}
