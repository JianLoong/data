It examines their origins and outcomes, and the ways in which they drew from and contributed to an emerging international framework. Further case studies include women\u0027s rights and sexual liberation, freedom of speech, capital punishment, economic justice and unfair trade. The unit examines the development of global movements and organisations, new technologies and tactics of protest and the formation of virtual communities of activism. It also covers the relationship between universal notions of justice and differences of gender, culture and belief, and potential differences between local and global understandings of \u0027rights\u0027.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS4810","eftsl":0.25}
