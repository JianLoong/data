But the ideal of \u0027rule by the people\u0027 is not easy to achieve, and faces particular difficulties in large-scale modern societies characterised by institutional complexity, pluralism/multiculturalism, and globalization. This unit considers what the ideal of democracy can mean in contemporary political life, and how (or whether) it can be institutionally achieved.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3905","eftsl":0.125}
