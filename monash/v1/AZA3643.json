The path from colonies to independent states seeking to control their own destinies within the modern post-World War 2 international context has been a long and challenging one.  Tracing developments from colonial regimes through the first independent states to the modern African states, we will see how men and women, political and economic elites, peasants and workers, religious and cultural leaders endeavoured to create new forms of meaning and power.  Central themes concern the characteristics of African states, relationships between states, political parties and a growing civil society, developmental paths and the relationships between African states, their subjects and citizens and the complex cross-currents of wider international worlds from 1945 into the current period of globalization.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"AZA3643","eftsl":0.125}
