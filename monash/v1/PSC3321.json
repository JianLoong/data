Students will review the structure and function of the nervous system and important aspects of neurotransmission and cell signalling, and will then consider in detail exemplar disorders involving the nervous system, such as Parkinson\u0027s disease, schizophrenia, depression, pain, and multiple sclerosis, and disorders affecting blood-brain barrier function. The aspects of these disease states which are amenable to pharmacotherapy will be discussed in detail and students will perform a number of tasks which will help with the development of critical thinking skills.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences","unitCode":"PSC3321","eftsl":0.125}
