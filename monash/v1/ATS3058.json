The aim of this unit is to analyse and understand how the late-twentieth century process of transformation in Italian society has been reflected in the literary production. Students will read and study a number of texts, both fiction and non-fiction, dealing with aspects of contemporary Italian life and society. Students will have the opportunity to learn more about Italy today, and about the way in which Italian writers use their craft to respond to important social issues. In particular, this subject intends to highlight the main traits of a \u0027new\u0027 literature that is gradually enriching the Italian cultural horizon: texts produced in Italian by writers who originally belong to other cultures and who have chosen Italy as destination of their migration, as well as texts exploring Italy\u0027s place in the world and its interaction with other cultures. The unit will be taught in intensive mode over three weeks.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Arts","unitCode":"ATS3058","eftsl":0.125}
