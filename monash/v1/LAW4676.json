Students learn about the heuristics and shortcuts that people use to arrive at judgments and decisions, and the possible biasing effects this has on lawyers, juries, eye-witnesses, and judges. The course challenges students to discover best approaches to advocacy, when voluminous information must be presented to triers of fact. It highlights creative opportunities for evidence, in any matter of law that depends on what members of the relevant population think, believe, or intend to do. Classes are designed to foster high quality discussion and analysis providing an environment conducive to peer interaction and feedback with an emphasis on formative activities.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW4676","eftsl":0.125}
