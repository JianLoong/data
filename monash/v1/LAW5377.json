It then considers the second exception, collective action authorised by the UN Security Council, the use of force by UN peacekeepers, and action by \"coalitions of the willing\".  The unit analyses the right of a State to intervene in another State\u0027s civil war, the legality of humanitarian intervention, and the meaning and effect of the emerging doctrine of the responsibility to protect.  Through study of the major international cases on the use of force, and the continuing disagreements among scholars, the unit reveals the complexities of these apparently simple rules.","enjoyResponse":0,"faculty":"Faculty of Law","unitCode":"LAW5377","eftsl":0.125}
